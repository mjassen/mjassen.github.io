Project Plan for 2019 Week 35 and 36 - Quit coffee

By author Morgan Jassen

This is a plan for a two-week growth and learning project for weeks 35 & 36 of 2019.

- In these two weeks I will “quit coffee”.

- After the two-week project,  I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during the project, and what I learned.

<h2>Finances as a Team Sport</h2>

By author <a href="https://twitter.com/mjassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I previously wrote about "Why Does Middle Class Work Income Just About Equal Middle Class Expenses?" <a href="https://investorworker.lemonmama.com/2018/2018-12-13-middle-class-income-expenses.html">https://investorworker.lemonmama.com/2018/2018-12-13-middle-class-income-expenses.html</a>. 
It asks why middle class work income happens to be equal to living expenses, and looks for ethical problems and answers for you and me.

Also about "Get Passive Income Or Something so that Fear Surrounding Employment Income is not a Crippling Ailment" <a href="https://investorworker.lemonmama.com/2019/2019-06-01-employment-not-crippling-ailment.html">https://investorworker.lemonmama.com/2019/2019-06-01-employment-not-crippling-ailment.html</a>.
It points out how an individual depending on one stream of work income, can go hand-in-hand with crippling fear and mistrust.

Today points out that finances should be a team sport. People should collaborate with each other so that we can all gain abundant money income (not excessive, not scarce, just abundant). There is abundant opportunity in our world, and we should share the work and share the profit.

The individual income tax return seems to be oriented heavily towards individuals. It counts all the beans and taxes all the beans.

An answer may be corporation ownership -- a Limited Partnership or a C Corporation for example. They are designed to let money flow through to individuals without being taxed. Furthermore partners can put specific writing that tells how the profits flow through to each company-owner partner.

In conclusion, I think generating income, and finances, should be a team sport. Not limited to an individual person earning a single stream of work income and filing an individual tax return on it, but rather also that individual as one of a team of partners, working together, and also agreeing together on how finances should work for them.

Project Plan for 2019 Week 31 and 32

By author Morgan Jassen

This is a plan for a two-week growth and learning project for weeks 31 & 32 of 2019.

- Do strengthen my language ability in my target language.

- Do daily listen, speak, read, and/or write in my target language.

- Do work together in-person with another person on this project.

- On the final day, after two weeks, do blog a “Final report” describing what happened during this project, and what I learned.


[2019-07-25 Edit: Final report is here: <a href="https://i̶n̶v̶e̶s̶t̶o̶r̶w̶o̶r̶k̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2019/2019-08-11-project-report.html">https://i̶n̶v̶e̶s̶t̶o̶r̶w̶o̶r̶k̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2019/2019-08-11-project-report.html</a> ]

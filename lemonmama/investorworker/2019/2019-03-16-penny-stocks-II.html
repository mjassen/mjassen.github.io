Learning About Penny Stocks - An Example of an Over-the-counter Listed Company

Recently I wrote about <a href="https://i̶n̶v̶e̶s̶t̶o̶r̶w̶o̶r̶k̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2019/2019-03-15-what-are-penny-stocks.html">What are Penny Stocks and how to Learn More about Penny Stocks?</a>. I read about over-the-counter stocks.

I didn't know an example of one.

Then I was looking at job listings for a company that I have reason to be a real, established company, with an actual physical office near me. ( Dassault Systèmes <a href="http://www.3ds.com/">http://www.3ds.com/</a> )

I looked more at their website to find more about them, including investor information. I looked on wikipedia. It led me to find that they are listed on an "over-the-counter" market, which led me here: <a href="http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/DASTY/quote">http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/DASTY/quote</a>

The price at time (2016-Dec-04) of first draft of this post (before publishing) seemed to be 80-something dollars a share. So I'm not sure it's considered a "penny stock" or not.

(Note: Subsequently, the price at time (2019-Mar-16) of second draft of this post seems to be 140-something dollars a share [at the ^same link/page]) 

I'm coming from a relatively ignorant mindset -- one who wouldn't know the difference between the term "penny stocks" in reality vs. the scenes about "penny stocks" from the movie "Wolf of Wall Street" ¹. So looking back on this post later it'll probably be evident that I hardly knew much. But I'm learning and that's what I'm here to do. 

Plus I currently have limited knowledge about Dassault Systèmes company, and don't mean to say that it's a good nor bad nor other company -- it's merely that I've heard of the company in the real world by 1.) having walked by their physical campus a few times and seen their building signage and people coming and going and 2.) having browsed their website a bit.

In conclusion, I'm learning more about penny stocks and the OTC exchange, including having researched a bit about one company that seems to be listed on the "OTC exchange" (which also I am learning of/about at the same time).

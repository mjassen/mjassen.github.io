Project Plan for 2019 Week 27 and 28

By author Morgan Jassen

This is a plan for a two-week learning/growth project for weeks 27 & 28 of 2019.

- In these two weeks I will go through all possessions and re-organize them into a tidy configuration.

- On the final day, after two weeks, I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during the work-project, and what I learned.

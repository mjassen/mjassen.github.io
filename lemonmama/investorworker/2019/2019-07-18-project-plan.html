Project Plan for 2019 Week 29 and 30

By author Morgan Jassen

This is a plan for a two-week learning/growth project for weeks 29 & 30 of 2019.

- In the next two weeks I will buy a company.

- In order to buy a company I will be ready to perform the following:
* Buy a company.
* Look for a company.
* Find a company.
* Learn how to buy a company.
* Get past a roadblock to buying a company.

- Local and in-person, ask another person about what project they're working on, and listen.

- On the final day, after two weeks, I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during this project, and what I learned.

Today's post covers how to check email via Thunderbird mail client.

To learn about Thunderbird mail client, see: <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">https://www.thunderbird.net/</a>

Let's get right to it!


1.)
First, launch the Thunderbird mail client.

2.)
Next, we see Thunderbird launches into the Vertical View Layout, with the Folder Pane showing on the left, immediately showing a list of messages in the "Inbox" folder in the main/center pane.

I see today I have two old email messages in my inbox and one new one. (New messages are highlighted bold and also, on the left-hand Folder Pane, the number in parenthesis i.e. "Inbox(1)" in this case reflects the fact that I have one unread message.

3.)
Next, I want to read the new message so I double-click on it, which brings it up on the screen.

4.)
Finally, I am done reading the email and want to move it out of my inbox. I click-and-hold on the email message and drag-and-drop it into my local mail folder "investorworker_local" in this case.

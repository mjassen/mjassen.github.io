Project Plan for 2019 Week 37 and 38 - Learn Database Theory

By author Morgan Jassen

This is a plan for a two-week growth and learning project for weeks 37 & 38 of 2019.

- In these two weeks I will “learn database theory”.

- After the two-week project,  I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during the project, and what I learned.

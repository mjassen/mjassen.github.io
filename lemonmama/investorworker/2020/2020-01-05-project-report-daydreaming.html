Final report for Project for weeks 51 & 52 (2019) - Daydreaming and Meditating

By author Morgan Jassen

In this two week sprint I did:

- Traveled internationally and met with family.

- Contrary to plan, didn't focus formally on daydreaming and meditating.


In this two week sprint I learned:

- This was a flop mostly. I didn't have a formal structure and so learned that I may as well have not made this into a 2-week sprint project. However daydreaming is one thing that doesn't need focus nor structure, thus that part may be considered a success!

In conclusion, in weeks 51 & 52 (2019), I had a liesurely time and daydreamed.

PhpMyAdmin Complete Inserts Vs. Extended Inserts

note: originally published 2012-10-02 at a different domain name and url.

PhpMyAdmin “complete inserts”:
“complete inserts” means the column names are specifically named in the insert statement(s).

PhpMyAdmin “extended inserts”:
“extended inserts” checkbox ON means that it makes it into one big insert statement whereas if that checkbox is OFF it creates many separate insert statements, one for each data row.

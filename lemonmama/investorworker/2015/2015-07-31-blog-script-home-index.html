Blog Script that Acts as a Home Index Page to a Blog

2014 blog script. This script acts as an index page to the html file blog post pages. In an extremely simple sense I built it to replace my self-hosted WordPress installation.

In other words, it’s a Php Script to Show HTML Files for a Directory, and I can use this to be as the index (home page) for my blog of single-page blog posts.

Instructions:
– Write blog posts as .html files
– This .php file scans the directory for .html files and prints out on the page an alphabetized list with hyperlink to each.

I’ve put 2014 Blog Script on Github:

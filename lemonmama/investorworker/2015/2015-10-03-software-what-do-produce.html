As a Software Support and Development Engineer What I Do and What I Produce

As a Software Support and Development Engineer, the service that I perform is transmitting messages/instructions, and the goods that I produce are messages/instructions.

As a Software Support and Development Engineer, what service do I perform, and/or what goods do I produce? Is my current job Service-performing or is it Goods-producing?

What I do:
I transmit a message to another person. (for example I transmit a message from my computer screen to the other person’s computer screen)

What I produce:
I create a message. (For example I write a message consisting of step-by-step written instructions)

Therefore the answer is that as a Software Support and Development Engineer I do both service-performing and the Goods-producing.

To recap:
My primary service:
– Transport messages across distance with another person.

My primary goods-production:
– Produce messages, instructions and documents.

As a Software Support and Development Engineer, the service that I perform is transmitting messages/instructions, and the goods that I produce are messages/instructions.

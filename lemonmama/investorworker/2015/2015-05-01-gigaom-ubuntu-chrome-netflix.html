Gigaom Podcast Describes on Ubuntu on Chrome Browser Making Netflix Work

Gigaom podcast describes on Ubuntu on Chrome browser making Netflix work.

Previously on w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ I wrote on about “On Ubuntu OS on Firefox browser installng flash to make Pandora work” ( http://wieldlinux.com/?p=86 )

I listened to part of an episode of Gigaom Chrome podcast. They talked about now one can watch Netflix on Linux. One way is to get Ubuntu with Chrome browser and some DMG plugins/libraries, a stack which they say will give one the ability to watch Netflix.

At ~ 13min. 06sec. in.
“Chrome Show: New Chrome apps for Windows, OS X show Google’s strategy” ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/gigaom-chrome-show/id653892483?mt=2&i=320102611 )

Additional info:
I ran also into these references about Netflix on Ubuntu:

googleing the term:
netflix on ubuntu liberiangeek

Came up with these results:

“Watch Netflix Movies in Ubuntu”

In PHPLiteAdmin the Arrow Indicates the Sort Direction Ascending Versus Descending

In PHPLiteAdmin the arrow indicates the sort direction ascending versus descending.

Applies to:
phpLiteAdmin v1.9.5

Previously to determine the sort order, I clicked on the column header, looked at the first few entries, sorted them to tell what order it was in, then either left it there or clicked a second time to get the sort direction I desired.

No more of that– today I discovered the little arrow in phpLiteAdmin. If the table’s not being sorted by that column there is no arrow. If the column is being sorted by that column ASC the little arrow is there and points up. If the column is being sorted by that column DESC the little arrow is there and points down.

From now on I’ll click the column header once and see that it points up for ASC. If that’s what I want I’ll stop there– If I want DESC I’ll click it a second time and stop there.

Here, descriptive screenshot:
(In this screenshot, the arrow in the `date` column header is pointing up for ASC)

When a Software Support Engineer Views a Case Desk.com Records an Audit Log Entry

When a Software Support Engineer views a case, desk.com records an audit log entry.

In Desk.com it’s audited/recorded each time a Software Support Engineer views/opens a case.

For example when I open a case by typing the case number in the search box and hitting enter, Desk.com opens the case for me to view and on the left-hand-side under the “CASE TIMELINE” section it logs a message like this:

“Morgan Doe pulled case for editing Oct (dd), (YYYY) at 1:17PM (from Case Filter view)”

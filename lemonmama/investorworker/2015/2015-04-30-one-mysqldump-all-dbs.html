One mysqldump per DB vs One mysqldump for All DBs

note: originally published 2012-10-08 at a different domain name and url.

the question is, is it better to have one mysqldump for all databases for your nightly and/or weekly backup? or better to have multiple mysqldumps nightly, one for each database? I think the answer lies in whether you want to spend more time setting up the backup scripts, or whether you want to spend more time separating out the one database’s data at the time when a restoration is needed.

Service Desk Case Tracker Setting up Email Notifications for all Significant Case Activity in Desk.com

As a Software Customer Support Engineer I was finding it a challenge to monitor two incoming queues- the Service Desk Case Tracker queue and my email inbox. I wanted to make it easier. So I created Admin > Cases > Rules that trigger when my cases are updated in significant ways. The Rules trigger a Notification email.

So far this is much easier. Reactively, I now only have to monitor one incoming queue– my email inbox. There I immediately see an email Notification whenever a significant change happens in the Desk.com Case queue.

That frees me up to be able to work proactively towards my goals, including via the Desk.com case tracker replying/resolving cases.

Notes on Whom A Software Support Engineer is Serving

As a Software Support Engineer I’m making a push to always keep in focus *who I’m serving*.

I had previously put the first field of every item on my to-do list as the tag of what type of issue this item is. Now I’ve switched to put the first field of every item on my to-do list as the *name of the person for whom I’m performing* this task.

After previously having gotten caught up in *what support ticket I’m working on*, it’s a big improvement to switch to keep in focus who I’m serving.

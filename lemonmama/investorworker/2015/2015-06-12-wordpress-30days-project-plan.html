On Reading on the WordPress.org Support Forums

For 30 days, I’ll read 30 posts per day on the WordPress.org Support Forums. ( https://wordpress.org/support/view/all-topics ) The goal is to learn about Software Support. Afterwards I’ll post which posts I read and write a follow-up blog post of what I learned.

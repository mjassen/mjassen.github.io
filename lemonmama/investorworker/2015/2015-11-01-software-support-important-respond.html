It is Important for a Software Support Engineer to Respond to Software User Concerns

The point of this article is that the most important metric or goal is to reply software user concerns.

Previously I had considered that it’s important for a Software Support Engineer to focus on two important metrics/goals: 1. replying to software user concerns 2. resolving software user concerns.

The remix is that the most important metric for a Software Support Engineer is to focus on replying (responding) to software user concerns.

The reason is that as a Software Support Engineer I have control of whether I reply or not, how quickly I reply, the method of replying(for example Phone vs. email), and the contents of my reply. Thus this is what I should focus on, measure, and set as my goal.

The reason to not focus on resolving cases is that the case becomes resolved on its own or by the customer. So since as a Software Support Engineer I’m not the one who controls marking the case as resolved, I shouldn’t base measurements of my perfomance on this metric.

To summarize, instead of measuring my performance as a Software Support Engineer both on responding to software user concerns and on resolving software user concerns, instead I’ll try my idea that the most important metric or goal is to respond to software user concerns.

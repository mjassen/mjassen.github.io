In 2016 and 2017 Some Goals and Principles to Guide Career and Life

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author Morgan Jassen

Seven months ago, I jotted down this two-part bullet-pointed list of goals and priciples on a small piece of paper and tucked it away. Taking it out again and reading over it, I find that the list is still spot on, an accurate list of what my life and career should be focusing on at this point.

Here's the list of some goals and principles to guide career and life in 2016 and into 2017:

- maintain health
- grow wealth
- create value through working
- keep investing a priority
- share

- think long-term
- tune into an abundance mindset
- pursue integrity
- exercise humility to learn from others

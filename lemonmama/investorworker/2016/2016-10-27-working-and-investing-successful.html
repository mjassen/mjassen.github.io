Working and Investing and A Successful Software Engineer Career

Where working and investing intersect, there are the elements of a successful career. When a Software Engineer understands business and finance It will help them to do well in their career.

In March 2016, I left a note for myself to write a blog post about: "as a software engineer how financial literacy affects me"

More than six months later, I'm reading that note.

It's sticking.

I haven't stopped thinking about financial literacy since then. I've been reading books about investing such as these:

**     Rich Dad, Poor Dad : Kiyosaki, Robert T. ( <a href="https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/656002075_rich_dad,_poor_dad">https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/..._poor_dad</a> )
**     The Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Money ( <a href="https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1200242075_the_wall_street_journal_guide_to_understanding_money_amp_investing">https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/..._money_amp_investing</a> )
**     Rich Woman : Kiyosaki, Kim ( <a href="https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1176693075">https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1176693075</a> )
**     Start your Own Corporation : Sutton, Garrett ( <a href="https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3265606075_start_your_own_corporation">https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/...own_corporation</a> )
**     The Wall Street Journal Complete Home Owner's Guidebook : Crook, David ( <a href="https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1462586075_the_wall_street_journal_complete_home_owners_guidebook">https://bpl.bibliocommons.com...home_owners_guidebook</a> )

Also since then, I've blogged about:

"On Software Development and Support Engineer Pay Rate" ( <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php#2016-07-01">http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php#2016-07-01</a> )

, and:

"For a Software Development and Support Engineer Finances are Important" ( <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php#2016-06-04">http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php#2016-06-04</a> )

, and I've changed my blog tagline to:

"Stretching, investing, and working. Mingling." (Note: the addition of "..., investing, ...")

In other words, I'm starting to pay more attention to finances and investing, and blog about it.

Today six months later I came across a quote on a blog post that struck me as a description of how a low-level of financial literacy has affected me as a Software Engineer.

"...“regular employees,” which just means they’re businessmen with self-confidence issues and poor business skills. ..."
( <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">http://www.kalzumeus.com/20...-negotiation/</a> ).

The idea of the quote is that knowledge of how a business works is beneficial to everyone, and everyone is affected by businesses and how they run, whether they know it or not (or like it or not), therefore a "regular employee" is at a disadvantage because they are subject to how a business works while at the same time not understanding how a business works.

(although I'd call myself "businesspeople" instead of businessmen)

Why does the above quote particularly strike me in the context of my own life as a financially illiterate Software Engineer?

One could say I've long thought of myself as a "regular employee".

What does that mean for people like me in the financial and business world?

After starting to respect money more and reading a bit about it, I start to realize the truth in this idea that we are all business people, just some more ignorant of business and finance than others. (myself included first)

The point is, where working and investing intersect, there are the elements of a successful career. When a Software Engineer understands business and finance It will help them to do well in their career.

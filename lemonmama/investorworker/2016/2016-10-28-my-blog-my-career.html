My Software Developer and Support Engineer Blog is my Career

I just realized that for me, my blog is my Career.

Here’s exactly how I can develop my career by writing my blog:
– Starting today, every _x_ days, I blog a specific record of what I did in my job or life that aligns with my career. For example I could once a week (while it is still fresh in my head) Write down a few bullet points of my main accomplishments from the past week. Take out any confidential information, and it becomes a blog post.
– Say a year goes by and by that time I really want to get promoted to a more senior role.
– Now I send an email to the manager, that refers to specific, individual blog posts of my accomplishments. I look on my job board for a role similar to the role I’ve been doing, but more challenging role than the role I’ve been doing.

I find that because of my blogging, I now have _x_ specific records telling how I did the job that aligns with my career. Say for example I was a Junior Woodchuck for 1 year. And now I really want to apply to be a Senior Woodchuck in the company. I look back and see that in my blog posts, 10 of the posts described accomplishments that fit the core duties of a Senior Woodchuck. Bingo! I Write a letter to my manager for the Senior Woodchuck position with links to those ten(10) blog posts that prove that during the past year’s time, I’ve *already been performing the Senior Woodchuck role*.

What tools do I need to accomplish this?
– My blog containing my actual blog posts.
– A system that lets me write records of what I did throughout the week(s)/year(s).

Without the blog, I don’t have a public, available, trustworthy record of my weekly/yearly/lifetime accomplishments; I have no career– I only have a job.

With the blog, I have a public, available, trustworthy record of my weekly/yearly/lifetime accomplishments; I have a career. The Blog is important and is my career.

In the above ways, and with the above tools, I make my blog. This blog represents my Career. Thus the blog *is* my Software Developer and Support Engineer career.

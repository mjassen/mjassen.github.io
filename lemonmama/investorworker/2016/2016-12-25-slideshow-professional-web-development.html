Viewing the Slideshow of a Professional and so Learning About Real Web Development Processes

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

Following the persona of John Eckman, coming across this tweet (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeckman/status/806178432296058880">https://twitter.com/jeckman...880</a>) led me to this 28-slide slideshow, which I viewed, and from which I learned about professional Web Development processes.

This:

"Distributed, not Disconnected: Employee Engagement for Remote Companies" ( <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jeckman/distributed-not-disconnected-employee-engagement-for-remote-companies">http://www.slideshare.net/jeckman...remote-companies</a> )

Some of my take-aways afterwards:
<ul>
<li>Thanks to John's persona for having shared this. Including especially the screenshots depicting actual screens of tools being used by actual team members. For example Basecamp, "Behind the scenes" (WordPress) tool, Skype for business, video chat, Slack, etc. It is invaluable for me to be able to have this peek inside how another web development team works.</li>
<li>I can see that the processes would be re-usable for any company, remote or not. (distributed or not) Right on!</li>
<li>Holy checklists! The screenshot of some of the basecamp to-dos are intense -- filled with long detailed checklists of interrelated to-do list items!</li>
<li>Someone tweeted afterwards asking what tool was the "Behind the scenes" tool depicted in the slide pictures, and the reply was that "...it's a WordPress multisite with 7 or 8 different sites for different groups..."</li>
</ul>

In conclusion, from viewing the "Distributed, not Disconnected..." slideshow, I learned about some real, re-usable, invaluable Web Development processes.

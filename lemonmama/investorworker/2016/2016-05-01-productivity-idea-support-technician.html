Productivity Idea for Software Support Technician

As a Software Support Technician and Developer, for times when I need to quicken my focus and sharpen my response as a Software Support Technician. I am going to try this trick which will be to keep all to-do tasks in an external repository, like the service desk ticket system, and then load up only the one most important one into my calendar as an event with the current day and time as the time. If I had another one on my calendar that I hadn’t yet gotten to by the time that this new important one appeared, then I’ll put that other one into the external repository and take it off my calendar.

This way, my calendar is clear except for the one most important item that I must be doing right now. And so it’ll be obvious that it is the most important and should be done now.

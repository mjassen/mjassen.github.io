<h2>Thoughts on Having Listened to Delivering Happiness AudioBook
(audio book by Tony Hsieh)</h2>
<P>I developed an interest in how Automattic company does Software
Customer Support. I listened to an audio recording of a book popular
in WordPress.com Happiness Engineer (Software Customer Support
Engineer) employee circles: Hsieh, Tony. “Delivering Happiness:A
Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose”</P>
<P>I enjoyed the early chapters. They focused on the broad topic of
“profit” and mostly were stories of Tony Hsieh’s
entrepreneurship through the years.</P>
<P>Then I also enjoyed the middle section of the book which focused
on “passion”. Stories in this part of the book were sometimes
about how Tony got interested in Zappos company and how he an his
colleagues grew it in its earlier years.</P>
<P>The last part of the book broadly focused on “purpose”. And
parts in the middle-to-end of the book started talking heavily about
Zappos company culture, events that transpired at Zappos company and
with its people. I have to say that some parts in the middle-to-end I
didn’t enjoy as much.</P>
<P>The three parts of “profit”, “passion” and “purpose”
were mentioned by Tony within the book– I didn’t create these
labels.</P>
<P>What(‘s) (are) my take-away(s), and what did I think?</P>
<P>Over all, I very much enjoyed the book.</P>
<P>How does it relate to Software Customer Support, and, why does a
Automattic Happiness Engineer like to read it– and what from the
book can I apply to my own role as a Software Customer Support
Engineer?</P>
<P>A big take-away on software customer support from the book is that
customer support can be a way to differentiate one’s company. A
story from the book comes to mind when Tony Hsieh encouraged a
non-Zappos friend to call Zappos and ask where’s the best place to
order pizza. And the Zappos phone agent hardly missed a beat and did
help the caller friend look up a pizza place.</P>
<P>Another take-away is that Tony says the company put a lot of
resources into building a library and building a set of
courses/classes, and effort to hire within and to encourage employees
to move into higher-skilled roles in the company. My thought at this
point of the book is that I wished to know more about how the
employees viewed the courses/classes. At this time the company was
hundreds of employees. I wanted to know more about how the employees
view the courses/classes, and who among the employees participated in
the courses/classes.)</P>
<P>I guess I’ll have to keep thinking about it, maybe read the
paper version of the book later.</P>

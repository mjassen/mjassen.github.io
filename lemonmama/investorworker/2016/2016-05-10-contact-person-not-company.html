Contact a Person Not a Company — OR — A Feeling of Good Customer Service

I am feeling that good customer service is this:

As a customer, I contact a person instead of group/alias/company.

So the contact page on the company web site, there are pictures and names of 1-3 people and their phone numbers. And I contact them for support instead of contacting the “support nubmer” and their email addresses are there. and I email their addresses.

As a support person, I advertise for a customers to contact me as a person. Don’t contact a group/alias/company and end up talking with me. Instead contact me as a person who represents my company.

In short, communciation for customer service/support, no matter its between a company and a person, should be between an individual company representative and the customer. That’s good customer service.

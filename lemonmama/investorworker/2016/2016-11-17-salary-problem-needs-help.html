As a Web Developer or Software Support Person - Salary is a Problem that One Needs help to Solve

I wrote about SDASE salary -- (see: "On Software Development and Support Engineer Pay Rate" <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php?2016-07-01#2016-07-01">http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php?2016-07-01#2016-07-01</a> ) -- it's a recurring topic that I'm learning more about, and meditating over. I wrote before that I don't know how to get a high pay rate, but I feel it has something to do with professionalism, and something to do with asking for the salary from someone with power to give it.

Something else about it. A way to look at the question of "how to get a high pay rate?" is that getting it is something one needs help to get. I need to be able to ask for the salary I want. I need to be able to ask for help.

As a professional Web Developer or Software Support Person, if I have a problem that is my salary is not high to the level that I want it to be, then the ownership of the responsibility to solve the problem is mine. I need to do something. As a Web Developer or Software Support Person employee, I don't control a payroll and I don't approve my department's staffing budget and I don't set guidelines for HR salaries. The people in the roles of payroll manager, department manager, and hr manager, respectively, do.

In other words, this is a difficult problem, and one that I can't solve alone. How to proceed? I need to ask for help. I need to ask the person who's the finance manager for help, and ask the person who's the department manager for help, and ask the person who's the hr manager for help, to solve this.

I think that when I do ask, my professionalism will immediately be scrutinized -- I will be evaluated for how much value I'm adding to the company, i.e. how professional I am. Which is good! This should constantly be evaluated and I should constantly try to push it high. So that I can ask my fellow professionals to push my salary high.

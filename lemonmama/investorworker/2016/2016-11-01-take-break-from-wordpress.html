<h2>
It Was Time to Take a Break from WordPress for a While but Keep
Blogging about Software Development and Support
</h2>
<P>
In October 2015, I found something that I had deemed important,
such that it would probably take my time away from WordPress for
months. I thought I’d need to stop participating to WordPress
forums and WordPress chat.
</P>
<P>
Transcript in the Slack archives from when I wrote that I had to
take a break from WordPress.
<a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/forums/p1445275461001458">https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/...458</a> (A
Slack account is required – see: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat">https://make.wordpress.org/chat</a> )
</P>
<P>
I had worried that career development would suffer during this 90
days. I wouldn’t be learning via the WordPress community
participation.
</P>
<P>
Even so, I felt I’d still be learning in other ways. I felt I’d
keep talking to colleagues via other channels and meet new friends
and colleagues along the way. And I felt that I might learn things
and do things that I’d continue blogging about on my Software
Support and Development Engineer -related professional blog.
</P>
<P>
It immediately turned out that it was in a sense liberating to
clear my calendar of the weight of the WordPress “school”. Then
immediately I felt weird that I had thought WordPress activities
(“school”) was highly important, but now that I had started to
think something else was more important, that I could drop WordPress
like that. Sort of emotional – sort of made me want to laugh, and
cry.
</P>
<P>
At the same time I felt liberated, because that was the
underlying motivation to learn about WordPress in the first place —
as a way to learn about Software Support and Development Engineer
-related topics.
</P>
<P>
I wound this down by doing a couple of things: Took WordPress
reminders off my calendar, and removed WordPress bookmarks from my
browser.
</P>
<P>
I had thought it was like the then-current home page of
<a href="http://blog.josemcastaneda.com/">http://blog.josemcastaneda.com/</a> (Jose M Castaneda blog)
</P>
<P>“…I am a WordPress fanatic. I love to learn new things and
love to share my learnings. I have always loved open source and have
a love-hate relationship with it. I hate how much I love it,
sometimes. …”
</P>
<P>
I thought maybe it had turned out that I too sometimes hated how
much I loved WordPress, and maybe that’s why there was some relief
in the idea of taking a break from it for some time.
</P>
<P>
That’s what happened in October 2015 when I had found something
that I had deemed important, such that it would probably take my time
away from WordPress for months. I stopped WordPress community
participation for a while. It felt sad yet liberating. And I
re-discovered the essence of why I do WordPress as a type of “school”
in the first place — to learn about Software Development and
Support.

Communicate with the Customer

Once the boss that the Software Customer Support boss reports to told the whole support team to: “…communicate with the customer even if we don’t have an answer and even if we don’t have good news…”

So that brings up the question, is it the job of Support Engineer to “communicate with the customer”, period?

Is that the core of the job– to communicate with the customer?

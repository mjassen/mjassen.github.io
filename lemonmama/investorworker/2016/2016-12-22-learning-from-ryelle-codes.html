Learning Web Development from Ryelle.codes Blog Post on "WordPress REST API React/Redux helpers"

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

Sometimes I follow the online publishings of the persona of <a href="https://ryelle.codes">https://ryelle.codes</a>, especially because I've observed their habit of publishing about web-development -related topics.

This time, I navigated over to the blog and found this post, which is about using JavaScript to connect to WordPress via REST API and make a theme and more. Thank you to the author for having published this. I'm glad to have been able to read it and learned something.

Link to the blog post:
"WordPress REST API React/Redux helpers" (<a href="https://ryelle.codes/2016/10/wordpress-rest-api-reactredux-helpers/">https://ryelle.codes/2016/10/wor...-helpers/</a>)

One take-away is that the author used/leveraged multiple libraries, and called upon the libraries to pull data from WordPress and display the data in the web browser. Specifically, using these libraries they wrote that they were able to make a basic working page within 15 minutes.

Another take-away is that that the author was able to borrow code from another web developer's github project. Furthermore they included links to github these projects with specific code modules and/or snippets that they, and anyone, can use to do this sort of web development. Nice! I'll bookmark this so that when I need to do a similar project, I'll be able to refer to these code resources.

In conclusion, I'm thankful to the blog author for having shared this, and I was glad to have read this article, whereby I learned about web development using JavaScript, WordPress, and the WP-API, and I was also glad to have been given links to actual code resources that I can use myself.

<h2>Web Developer Work Conversations in the Context of the Company's
Bottom Line</h2>
<P>For a Web Developer work conversations should be in the context of
the company's bottom Line. (In the context of how one's work adds to
the company's profitability)</P>
<P>When the boss asks &quot;how are things&quot;, really the boss
means &quot;How are things in terms of your current project adding to
the company's bottom line?&quot;!</P>
<P>Is it really my job to listen and talk in this context?</P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P>Is it also my job as Web Developer *to realize* (to figure out)
that is that is the context that's being used -- to realize what is
really being asked?</P>
<P>Yes. That, too -- the figuring out-- is also the job of the Web
Developer -- is my job.</P>
<P>In conclusion, as a Web Developer it's my job to converse about my
daily work in terms of how it adds to the company's bottom line, also
my job to have figured this out..</P>
<P>Having thought this through, I feel good, and feel able to do my
job and grow my career!</P>

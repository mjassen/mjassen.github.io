<h2>For a Software Developer is a Salary More Like a Dial or Like a
Switch?</h2>
<P>To give at least some quantification context to this post. This
article &quot;2015-2016 Dice Salary Survey&quot; wrote that:
&quot;...Average technology salaries in the U.S. [increased] to
$96,370 annually...&quot; (
<a href="http://media.dice.com/report/2015-2016-dice-salary-survey/">http://media.dice.com/...-salary-survey/</a> )</P>
<P>So take an arbitrary scenario where a Software Developer's yearly
salary is currently $96,370.</P>
<P>Is it a switch where the Developer is either paid $96,370, -- or
else isn't employed?</P>
<P>Or is it a dial where the Developer could either somewhere in a
flexible range that is extremely loosely surrounding $96,370 -- could
even be half that or could be double that, -- or else isn't employed?</P>
<P>Or?</P>
<P>*and* who controls the switch/dial?</P>
<P>The hiring manager? HR person? Employee? Of all three in a joint
meeting? Or?</P>

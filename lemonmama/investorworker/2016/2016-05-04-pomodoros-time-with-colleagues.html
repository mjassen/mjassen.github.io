For a Software Development and Support Engineer an Unplanned Benefit of Working on Pomodoros is that I Spend more time Talking with Colleagues

I started working on pomodoros. I started to write about it here: <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php?2016-04-30#2016-04-30">http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php?2016-04-30#2016-04-30</a><del>w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016-04-30-local-calendar-pomodoros-productivity.php</del>

I did it to improve productivity and clear my mind so that throughout the day I would be able to re-focus and thus stay focused, on what’s important.

Every 30 minutes, I stop for two minutes to write a note of what I did, triage email and triage calendar.

It has indeed improved my productivity as a Software Development and Support Engineer, but also it’s improved another aspect of my professionalism. Now I’ve changed to where I, here-and-there throughout the week, *end up spending a few more minutes talking with my colleagues* face-to-face in the office.

Since I get up and stretch every half hour, and make a point to not sit down until at least 120 seconds later, I end up having nothing to do but listen to what my other colleagues next to me are talking about. As a result, I tend to stop and listen and ask what’s going on and start to participate in more brief conversations.

As a Software Development and Support Engineer, I’ve found that a benefit of working on pomodoros is that I spend more time talking with colleagues.

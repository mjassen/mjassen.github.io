<h2>For a Web Developer how to Advance My Career Through Networking?</h2>
<P>I want to do professional networking, make some professional
connections, and make the connections last -- not many of them go
beyond the group where we met. The professional relationships usually
stay in the medium where they started. Next time at the monthly
meetup I again say hi. Or maybe not. At least it feels that way.</P>
<P>How to bring my career professional networking to a &quot;next
level&quot;?</P>
<P>Career remix!! Do it with peple! Network all the things!!!</P>
<P>Here are some ways that I have, or can, network:</P>
<ul><li>In-person</li>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>Written messaging (email, blog, twitter, chat, forums)</li></ul>
<P>There are a lot of channels there; how to focus my overall
networking strategy?</P>
<P>1.) Continue calling individual people on the phone (like in: &quot;For
a Software Developer How to Network&quot; (<a
href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php#2016-08-31">http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php#2016-08-31</a>)).</P>
<P>2.) FOLLOW PEOPLE, (not projects/things/blogs/processes) Meaning,
once I meet some people at a professional meetup or wherever, don't
only wait until the next monthly meetup to contact them again. For
one person with whom I got along well and was professional, call or
email them before then to check in and ask what they're up to and
learn from them.
</P>
<P>3.) Move away from only blogging on whatever I want, all by
myself. Instead, after having talked with someone about a topic.
Later, blog about that specific topic. With the person's permission,
find out whether or not the person would agree to me mentioning them
in the blog. If they say yes, mention them in the blog post. This
way, it is networking at the same time as blogging!</P>
<P>4.) On twitter, tweet @ people. Don't just tweet a link to my blog
post and hoping someone sees it, instead tweet it @ someone whom I
see tweeting about something related. Join in conversations on
twitter. @ people is the key.</P>
<P>5.) In general, online, don't just read. Reply there. Join in the
chat conversation. Calmly voice my professional opinion on
professionaly relevant topics.</P>
<P>6.) Read .org forums then reply, the goal being to connect with
the person. Find out who I'm replying to. Look for forum posts
written by people who are active on their own public channels like
blog or twitter, etc. Follow them on their public channel and if they
write with professionalism and if it resonates with me, then publicly
comment over there.</P>
<P>8.) Make it about the *PEOPLE*/PERSON. At an in-person event or
online, always be looking network by having a conversation with
someone. ( As opposed to just going to the group and listening to a
speaker's talk and then going home) In addition, talk about the event
or the project with someone, both before &amp; after. Always. This is
what makes it networking as opposed to mere media consumption.</P>
<P>9.) At an in-person meetup, ask someone where they publish online,
or how to reach them after the event. Afterwards, I liked what they
had to say and if they were professional, then read what they're up
to in their public online space. Comment back to them there. To be
genuinely interested and curious, I should seek the person on *their*
preferred online public medium. So, if they like to blog then I can
follow their blog and comment to them. If on their about page they
publish their email address welcoming feedback then I can email them
telling what I think of their blog post.</P>
<P>Finally I should remember it may be structured professional
networking but it shouldn't be forced or non-genuine. Personally I
have had bad experiences with a conversation trying to be forced
(from both ends -- at times I've been the person trying to force a
conversation, and at times someone has tried to force a conversation
with me). That's unpleasant, akin to meeting an overly-pushy
salesperson. If there's no professional chemistry, don't force the
conversation; drop that thread. Chase the conversations where there's
chemistry there!</P>
<P>These have been some ideas that can form a strategy of how to, as
a Web Developer, advance my career through networking.</P>

Gaining Inspiration from Entrepreneurs Investing by Infringing on Pokemon GO and by Counterfeiting Lead Nickels

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

Listening to Carrie Dils Officehours.fm podcast "Turning Tables, Episode 112" ( <a href="http://officehours.fm/podcast/112-2/">http://officehours.fm.../112-2/</a> ). At 01hr.00min.25sec., Carrie Dils' persona says she tried to create Pokemon GO T-shirts to sell, but within days got shut down.

I didn't think too much of it, just thought to myself: "...what would drive her to do that?..."

As her persona spoke about it in hindsight on the podcast, she was speaking from a point of view of it already having been deemed a bad idea in hindsight, because she was looking back on it, knowing it had been shut down, and at this point already realized as a bad idea.

Then, just the next day, I listened once again to audiobook of "Rich Dad, Poor Dad"* by Kiyosaki. Specifically, I listened to the part where he and his friend Mike are counterfeiting Nickels from lead.

This was when I realized, Officehours Carrie Dils' story about Pokemon GO, is a story of an instance of true entrepreneurship (like a business-person, investor) in the spirit of Kiyosaki. Dils' persona is exercising her financial genius, looking for opportunities to make money through investing.

In conclusion, through the two stories above, the personas of Dils and Kiyosaki have inspired me towards investing and entrepreneurship.

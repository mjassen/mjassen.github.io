My Goal of Financial Independence and how to Reach it Via Web Developer Professionalism

My goal and how to get to it step-by-step as directly as possible.

My goal is to maintain a state of financial independence, so that if I can't work (for any one of numerous reasons like disability, unemployment, old age, need to care for a disabled loved one, want to travel the world for a month in the summer, etc. etc. ) then my income will still support me until I get back to work.

How to attain financial independence?

Buy sufficient quantity of cash flowing assets.

Properly market my professional employment status.

Constantly be professional, and be vocal about it with others while I'm doing it.

Constantly pay attention to how others are being professional, and pay attention to how they are being vocal with me as they do it.

The above is a map of my goal of financial independence, and how to reach it via Web Developer professionalism. It starts with listening to other vocal professionals, progresses through being professional and through selling my professionalism, and ends with financial independence.

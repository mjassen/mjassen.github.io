Reasons a Software Development and Support Engineer Should Strive to Kick Ass at Their Current Job

Reasons a Software Development and Support Engineer should strive to kick ass at their current job (do their current job well), that have nothing to do with their current job. In other words why it benefits one’s *own* career to perform well at work.

The scope of this idea is that this applies to all jobs past, present, and future.

This can be seen as a pep-talk for *anyone*, however may be especially poignant for a Software Development and Support Engineer who either isn’t currently getting a lot of job satisfaction at their current job, or feels underappreciated by management at their current job, or feels underpaid, etc. etc.

The point is that as a Software Development and Support Engineer there are *big* reasons for performing well, that benefit a Software Development and Support Engineer as an individual professional — reasons that have nothing to do with how much one’s currently paid, nothing to do with how much job satisfaction one’s currently getting, and nothing to do with how (under)appreciated-by-management one feels at one’s job.

Of course, it doesn’t hurt a Software Development and Support Engineer’s employer either that one is high-performing! It’s a win-win — it’s good for the employer and the employee.

Reasons:

1. The colleagues at one’s current job will be needed to be references in the future, years down the road. Not only for changing jobs to a different organization but for promotions within the current organization. In other words people hire and promote a person who is regarded by their colleagues as a professional high-performer.

2. If a Software Development and Support Engineer wasn’t kicking ass at their job with their current organization, then the Software Development and Support Engineer would be kicking ass at their job with another organization. In other words, no matter the current situation at ones current job, it’s still in one’s interest to strive to be a high-performer. After all, as a a Software Development and Support Engineer, if I wasn’t doing a kick-ass job at this organization, then I’d be doing a kick-ass job at some other organization.

The point of this pep-talk is that as a Software Development and Support Engineer, the above-mentioned are some *big* reasons for performing well, that benefit a a Software Development and Support Engineer as an individual professional.

I’m taking my calendar productivity to a next level.

I’ve made calendar changes and, as a Software Development and Support Engineer I stopped using shared calendar, instead using a local calendar. This has been an improvement. However I need to check my calendar more often so as to not miss anything. But not check it *too* often so as to not waste time.

Here’s my new strategy. I set 30 minute pomodoros. Every time 30 minutes rolls around, I stretch, breathe, check email and check calendar. This only takes between 4-10 minutes to do, and it breaks my Software Development and Support Engineer schedule nicely to clear my mind and increase my productivity.

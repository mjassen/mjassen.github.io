Software PHP WordPress Developer Update About Using Git and Github.com

I while back, I did this. I got my git client partway configured to push to my github.com repository.

I got through many error/warning/notice messages.

Then I prepared to get throug the latest notice message that the git client was showing, so that I could push my mzz-stat project to github via Linux Ubuntu git client.

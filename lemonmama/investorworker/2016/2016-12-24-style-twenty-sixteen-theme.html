Learning by Making A Style With Elements from the Twenty Sixteen Theme

I have a site (this w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶) that is mostly static html pages. It had pretty much no styles applied. I wanted to apply the WordPress Twenty Sixteen theme to it. But it's not running WordPress.

What, then, to do?

I investigated the Twenty Sixteen theme to figure out what would be a minimalist representation of it -- that would give my site some style and make it look good, without being heavy with CSS and without being an exact copy of the entire style.

As it turned out, I found three main style elements that really made my site feel more like Twenty Sixteen, and at the same time I learned about CSS and about design!

Here's a link to the result. A html & css web page style that incorporates three components that are similar to the WordPress Twenty Sixteen theme styles:

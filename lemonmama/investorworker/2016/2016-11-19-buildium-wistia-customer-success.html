Buildium Boston Combines Forces with Wistia Cambridge to Publish Customer Success Story

Wistia's 'customer success stories' article entitled "Buildium" not only highlighted two of the companies that I like, but also taught me a bit about each company.

Having gotten interested in the company because I heard they hosted CSxCS Meetup at their venue in Fall 2016, I started to follow (Boston-based) Buildium.

Because I had previously, out of professional interest, followed the online persona of one of their long-term employees, Wistia is another (Cambridge-based) company I have been interested in following.

Following the Buildium blog, I came across an article. Then following its author and searching the web to see what else they had been up to, I came across this interview-style article on Wistia's website: "Buildium" ( <a href="https://content.wistia.com/customer-stories/buildium">https://content.wistia.com/customer-stories/buildium</a> )

I'm grateful for having been able to read this article on Wistia.com, because in doing so I learned a bit about how things work at Buildium -- how they are trying to do marketing, support, and training, also including some history of how things used to be done at Buildium, as well as what they'll try next. I even learned a bit about the role of Epay in property management. (Learned this about Epay from a short video, which was linked/embedded in the article.)

Not only that, but I learned about some features of the Wistia platform, notably their metrics, captioning-and-description-SEO, and replace video (versioning) features. These features were all highlighted in the article.

Also, I was inspired by the fact that people from both companies were willing to come together, share, and put some effort into creating this article. It seems like a win-win-win to me -- Buildium, Wistia, and the reader of the article (myself in this case) all win. (The first by gaining marketing exposure, the second also by gaining marketing exposure, and the third by learning, respectively.)

In conclusion, Wistia's 'customer success stories' article entitled "Buildium" not only highlighted two of the companies that I like, but also taught me a bit about each company.

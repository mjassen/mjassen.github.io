Update to Previous Plan for “2016-04-10 to 2016-05-10 Open Source Volunteer … Work-project )” Post

Previously I blogged “Plan for 2016-04-10 to 2016-05-10 Open Source Volunteer Software Development and Support Engineer “Mentorship” ( Job-shadow / Informational-interview / Work-project )” ( <a href="http://wieldlinux.com/2016.php?2016-04-10#2016-04-10">http://wieldlinux.com/2016.php?2016-04-10#2016-04-10</a> )

Update:

Today Mid-stream / in-flight (meaning: while the project is already underway), I’m halving the project length while doubling the daily-office-hours-time-length. So I’ll do 15 days (with “final report” on day 16 (days 1-15 being April 11th to April 25th, and day 16 being 2016-04-26)). And “office hours” will become 5am-6am daily.

I think that this change will both allow the Work-project to be be more impactful to the community, as well as allow deeper learning (quicker iterations of deeper dives) for myself.

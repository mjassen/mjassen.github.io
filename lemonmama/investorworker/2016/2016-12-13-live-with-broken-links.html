Being a Blogger and Learning how to Live With Broken Links

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I have a thing for not liking broken links on my blog website. If I do a migration that I know will create broken links, or for whatever other reason, then I feel like I have to go back and fix them.

This is nice, but its not necessary. I learned this from reading one of my new favorite blogs to read, richdad.com. I read an article there, that contained a hyperlink that I wanted to read more. I clicked it. It brought me to a clever picture saying the page couldn't be found. I thought: "oh, well", and then forgot about it and went back and kept browsing.

Not all links are broken on richdad.com, just a few. Most of them still work, so I'm not further discouraged from still trying them when I see them.

In conclusion, I learned that it's not the end of the world if some links are broken on my site.

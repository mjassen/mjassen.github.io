Once Again With the Water-Drinking from the Beaver Mug

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I previously blogged about "Seven Days of Hydrated Water-drinking Non-coffee..." <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php#2016-11-10">http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php#2016-11-10</a>

Result was positive-- I was off coffee for at least a few days, not quite a week.

I talked about it. People asked about it. It was always within arm's reach, always with at least a little water in it.

Mostly. One time I carried it but in my pocket, with no water in it.

The end of the week, I stopped carrying it, and was back on coffee.

Time to quit coffee again. So I'll start with this previous bit of success, and build off of it.

I will aim for 1 week with the cup, then after that, to continue on beverage-water-only on my own.

This time though, I'll do something else, something new to strengthen the process. Three times each day, as I do my morning, noon, and night stretches, I'm going to envision the taste and the feeling of yummy hydrating water.

Every time I crave coffee, I'm going to immediately sip tiny, deliberate sips of water from the cup already in my hand.

I'm going to grow healthy by replacing habits of coffee, with habits of water-drinking and stretching.

Afterwards I'll plan to again write to follow up how it went.

<h2>
Software Developer One Specific Professional Networking Tip And How It Has Worked for Me
</h2>

<P>This has to do with improving a Software Developer’s soft
skills, has to do with how to talk more with others.
</P>
<P>In another post I wrote about how to do networking deliberately
and on to do it on a schedule. ( For a Software Developer How to
Network (<a

</P>
<P>That’s another topic — this post covers one specific part of
that previous post.
</P>
<P>Today’s tip is to, when calling someone to network, make sure to
*explicitly mention that the reason I called is to say hi, to ask how
they are doing, and to chat*
</P>
<P>The key here is to tell the person up front that’s what I’m
doing.
</P>
<P>That way it’s not weird that I seemingly spontaneously call the
person. Also saying this up front clears the air and sets the
expectation — I’m not calling to sell them something, and it’s
not an emergency call, and I’m not calling to give them something —
it’s a networking call — I’m calling specifically to say hi,
ask how they are doing, and chat!
</P>
<P>Interestingly I fisrt developed this tip for myself with phone
call networking and not until later started to use it for in-person
and written-correspondence networking.
</P>
<P>The times I’ve used this tip, I’ve had good results with the
person positively receiving this type of networking call.
</P>
<P>Another tip is: to not take it personally if someone doesn’t
respond or if someone says now’s not a good time or if someone says
they’re busy.
</P>
<P>However those are for other days.
</P>
<P>Today’s tip is to tell the person that this is why you’re
calling.

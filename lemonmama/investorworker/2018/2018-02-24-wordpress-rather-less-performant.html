WordPress Self Hosted Is Rather Less Performant Out Of The Box

By author Morgan Jassen

At ~24min.30sec. of the Matt Report podcast episode ("Jake Goldman on (Larger) Agency Life and Products") ( <a href="https://mattreport.com/jake-goldman-larger-agency-life-products/">https://mattreport.com/jake-goldman-larger-agency-life-products/</a> )(2017-03-05 iTunes podcast) Someone (The Persona of Jake Goldman on this podcast) actually implies that Wordpress isn't performant out of the box! (i.e. without tuning):

"Getting WordPress to run well ... ... out of the box..."

At ~35min.17sec. in though, Jake's Persona clarified that small agencies can use WP to make a small business making lifestyle sites etc.

I agree with what Jake's Persona said, and I think it's not that it WordPress isn't/can't be made to be a good solution and made to run fast, but rather that if its desired to have a performant, live, website, with active visitor activity, it'll more often than not take some tuning, rather than just installing WordPress out of the box (out of the box meaning download from WordPress.org and manually install it.) For example it may want a caching plugin, or some hardening of admin-ajax.php, or hardening of wp-admin/ directory, or any number of other modifications, depending on the end goal.

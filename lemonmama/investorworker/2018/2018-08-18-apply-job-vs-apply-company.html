Applying for A Job and Applying for The Job and Applying for The Company

By author Morgan Jassen

My culture including unemployment benefit system and internet job search boards (linkedin, indeed, more..) can stress the importance of finding "a" job. It lumps all (or most to be technically accurate) as having something fundamentally similar with each other.

This might work to some degree, but on the other hand, it is setting me, and us, up for failure. How?

If I go to one place to find all jobs, then I (the job seeker), and the job poster, have already indicated that I am similar to most other job seekers, and that this job is similar to most other jobs.

In other words, it indicates that the employee is looking for "a" job, and the employer is looking for "an" employee.

In other words, we haven't even gotten started with the process, at this point anyone will do.

However, this is realized by a lot of people, and so there are the other multiple steps to job (resume, screening, interviews, references) that can result in one candidate being picked.

To me it would make more sense for the employee to go to the website of the employer that they like, and apply for the company. Or have an open house. I'm still figuring this out.

Also, there's something else broken with the job process, and I haven't figured it out, and so I don't yet know how to fix it. It may be the difference between inbound marketing and outbound marketing though. Maybe all jobs and all candidates can all use inbound marketing, and then someone just pairs them up, and voila!

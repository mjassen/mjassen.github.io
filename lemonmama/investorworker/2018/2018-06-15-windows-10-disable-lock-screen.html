On Windows 10 Home How to Disable Splash Screen and Show Password Field on Startup (Disable Lock Screen)

by author Morgan Jassen

Compared to Mac OS X that first boots up to the cursor in the login password field, Windows 10 first boots to a splash screen of a picture. (A Lock Screen of a picture) In order to proceed to type a password one must first click or tap somewhere.

After having used Mac and being able to quickly type password... ...the quick way's better.

How to make this happen in Windows 10? Read on...

Searching for: ...windows 10 startup prompt for password no splash screen... and then digging around apparently this is called the Lock Screen. This article did work to make this happen. *Specifically* the part of the article right after the article text "...If you wish, you can also disable the Windows 10 / 8 Lock Screen by editing the Registry Editor. ..." this:

"How to Enable or Disable Windows 10 Lock Screen" <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-lock-screen-windows-8">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-lock-screen-windows-8</a>

In short, here's a working way how to disable the Lock Screen in Windows 10 (Disable the splash screen in Windows 10) here:
regedit.exe >> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization >> new DWORD called NoLockScreen >> set value to 1 >> restart Windows

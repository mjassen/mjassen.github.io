There are Plenty of Abundance Mindsets

By author Morgan Jassen

This year a goal of mine is to: "Tune into an abundance mindset".

But then I started to worry that what if there's only one abundance mindset, and I'm not able to get tuned into it?

No worries, there are an abundance of abundance mindsets, and there will be enough time to tune into any of them that are needed.

There are money abundance mindsets, time abundance mindsets, friends abundance mindsets, general all-purpose abundance mindsets, and more,... and they are continually available to be tuned-into, ongoing.

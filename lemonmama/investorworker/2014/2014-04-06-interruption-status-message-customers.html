<h2>It’s Excellent and There is no Downside for a Saas Provider to
Provide the Performance Interruption Status Message to Customers</h2>

<P>Here’s my own experience and my own feeling on a topic that has
also been covered on SupportOps.co hangout/podcast. I came to the
same conlcusion that they did.</P>

<P>Recently at the top of my help desk’s saas web page appeared a
message saying that they were investigating performance problems that
are delaying their secondary service.</P>

<P>I noticed right away and felt that: 1. that this is
transparent(the fact that i am informed of the problem while the
problem is not-yet-resolved), 2. that it benefited me by comforting
me that my saas provider was aware-of/working-on the issue, and 3.
that the downside was that negative publicity that all of the saas
provider’s users now knew there was a problem and it’s not fixed
yet.</P>

<P>Then thinking about this again, and thinking in light of the
recent SupportOps.co hangout/podcast that I had listened to, I
realized there is no downside. Number 3. doesn’t apply. in the
above example, I am not a customer of the secondary service, only of
the primary service which is running fine. And so the message does
not apply to me. So I just ignore it. As long as I’m not constantly
flooded with such messages, I don’t care.</P>

<P>And on the other hand, if I were a customer of their secondary
service, I’d actually appreciate the fact that the saas provider is
keeping me informed. Therefore there isn’t any downside in the
above Software Customer Support scenario — it’s excellent that
the saas provider transparently provided this performance
interruption status message to their customers.</P>

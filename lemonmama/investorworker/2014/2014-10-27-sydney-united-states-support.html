Between Sydney and the United States Doing Software Customer Support?

It’s discussed in episode 18 of the Support Driven podcast! (link to podcast and website below!)

In one part of episode 18 of the Support Driven podcast, it’s discussed that a weekly newsletter is one way to keep the globally-disbursed Software Support Engineers together– a weekly newsletter that includes large and small details about what happened that week in the software support department/group. It’s discussed that this may even make the entire company feel closer.

In one part of episode 18 of the Support Driven podcast, it’s mentioned that the time-of-day when the Sydney team meets with the United States team is 5am Sydney time. ( that would be 3pm or 2pm New York time)

In one part of episode 18 of the Support Driven podcast, it’s mentioned that with remote worker Software Support Engineers in all timezones, at the end of the shift the Engineer from one timezone writes a report for the person coming onto the next shift– a report including what important things happened during their shift.

Where it is Discussed the Difference Between the Role of Software
Support Forum Moderator Support Person and Software Troubleshooting
Support Person

In this #wordpress-sfd IRC meetup, it is discussed the difference
between the role of software support forum moderator support person
and software troubleshooting support person:

<a href="http://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-sfd&day=2014-05-29&sort=asc#m114328">http://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-sfd&day=2014-05-29&sort=asc#m114328</a>

So in other words two distinctly different roles both expected of
a software support agent,

1. Define and explain what is supported and what is not supported,
and

2. Troubleshoot/support the things that are supported.

On Ubuntu OS on Firefox Browser Installng Flash to Make Pandora Work

Relevant software versions:
Ubuntu 12.04
Firefox v30.0

Pandora wouldn’t work for me on Firefox v30.0 on Ubuntu 12.04 install. A message came up on the web page told me to install flash player. Then I googled and found this command recommended:

sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer

I ran it from a terminal (command shell)(command prompt) and it ran fine.

The result is the next day I tried Pandora.com in Firefox on Ubuntu and Pandora now works fine.

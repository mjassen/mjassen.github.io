For a Software Support Engineer, Triaging Cases is Different than
Working on Cases

I’ve had to triage cases. It’s much different than working on
(Solving or Progressing) cases.

When triaging I quickly touch each case and prioritize and
categorize it, maybe write a quick initial response.

Then later after all the cases have been triaged, I can go back
and work on the cases (solve or progress them), the highest priority
ones first.

In summary, triaging Software Customer Support Cases is different
from working on Software Customer Support Cases.

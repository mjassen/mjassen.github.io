<h2>Into What Role Does a Software Support Engineer Grow?</h2>
<P>Part of the answer is they grow into a COO. Like Chief Operating
Officer or another role that reports to the COO. The other part is
that a Software Support person touches every part of the
organization. Sales, Operations, Engineering. And so it is possible
for a support person to grow into any of those fields that they are
passionate/inclined/skilled at. So they could end up as a CEO-type,
COO-type or CTO-type.</P>
<P>But the reason that the likely role for a Software Support
Engineer is most likely to end up as COO role, is if one sticks to
the core responsibilities of a Software Support Engineer (for example
triaging customer issues, Solving customer issues, using/testing
software, promoting software, and many others), then one will be
doing jobs that are considered operations. I mentioned in a previous
post, <a href="https://investorworker.lemonmama.com/2013.php#2013-12-28_1157">Ramblings on Whether There Will Ever be a Standard Job Title for a Software Support Engineer</a>, that in the Support industry a
Support Person is sometimes viewed as an infantry. Indeed, there are
parallels between Military/Police/Government-Executive-Branch-Type
roles and Software Support. So if a Software Support Engineer excels
at these, then they could naturally move towards a position of an
operations role.</P>
<P>For example in <a href="http://supportdriven.com/2014/01/22/episode-4-adventures-in-customer-support-with-aaron-wheeler/">the Support Driven podcast episode. 04</a>, at 14min.,55sec.
someone mentions that the support manager’s boss is the COO.</P>
<P>To conclude, because of the breadth of the software business that
they touch, a Software Support Engineer role can grow into many
career roles in Sales, Engineering or other, but more specifically,
an appropriate role for a Software Support Engineer to grow into is
COO or a role that reports to COO.</P>

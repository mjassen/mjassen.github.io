Thoughts on Having Read the Blog Post of The 2016 Wistia Rap-Up

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I just geeked out for a full 30 minutes reading, following/reading links, and watching the Rap-Up video, here:

"The 2016 Wistia Rap-Up" <a href="https://wistia.com/blog/2016-rap-up">https://wistia.com/blog/2016-rap-up</a>

One big takeaway, other than the message that Wistia has an awesome fun culture, was a daily routine checklist that I saw after having clicked through one of the links in the blog post.

I browsed through, and somehow ended up on this blog post from the blog of the persona of "Wistian" Chris Savage:
"Being Busy Doesn’t Mean You’re Successful" (<a href="https://savagethoughts.com/being-busy-doesnt-mean-you-re-successful-4c56852a8d55#.81v9uzo2a">https://savagethoughts.com/being-busy-doesnt-mean-you-re-successful-4c56852a8d55#.81v9uzo2a</a>)

My big takeaway was I saw in the blog post that Chris' persona had shared a day-in-the-life of his routine. This day-in-the-life is shared halfway into the blog post, under the heading of "Here’s what my new calendar looks like:...".

I'm inspired by this post, and this part of it, because I'm glad to see that they are fighting for unstructured time.

Indeed, when they wrote that they had made two big chunks of unstructured time in their schedule, I thought to myself: "oh, good -- they made two times per week when they can have free time to think and create...".

Then, when I saw the "new calendar" list I realized to myself "oh, turns out that they made two hour-long times per **day** when they can have free creative time...!"

In conclusion, the 2016 Wistia Rap-Up blog post and video is a lot of fun, but also links to what the individual company people have been up to, so from reading it I was able to pick up a professional tip about how to schedule unstructured time.

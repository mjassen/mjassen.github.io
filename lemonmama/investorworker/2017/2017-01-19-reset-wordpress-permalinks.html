How to Set WordPress Permalinks Back To The Way They Were

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

(Note: This content was originally published in October 2016 on wordpress.org/support as forum posts authored by me. (see: <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-set-permalinks-back-to-post-name-and-avoid-404-not-found-error/">https://wordpress.org/support...404-not-found-error/</a> ) This blog post is a condensed re-publishing that highlights the exact problem and fix, and omits unnecessary verbiage. For context and additional details, read the full/original forum post!)


Symptom:
"...
How do I avoid “404 Not Found” error after having set my permalinks back to “Post name” after having temporarily set them to Plain/Default?
..."


Solution:
"...
In short, the fix for me was to go into the WordPress admin dashboard, go to:

“Settings” > “Permalinks” > “Common settings”, and set the radio button to “Custom Structure”

, and paste into the text box:

/index.php/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/

, and click the Save button.

Now, no longer getting 404 error. Symptom resolved!
...
Hopefully this can help someone in the future with the exact same question.

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

This is the final report for the work project described here:
"Plan for 2017-01-20 WordPress Plugin Developer Open Source Volunteer Work-project" (<a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2017.php?2017-01-19_1100#2017-01-19_1100">http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2017.php?2017-01-19_1100#2017-01-19_1100</a>)

What happened during the work project, and what did I learn?


- I supported a plugin to support Brazilian portugese language. ("Language translation" (<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/language-translation-26">https://wordpress.org/support/topic/language-translation-26</a>))

- On most days, I read about 10 forum posts.

- On most days, I said hi on the WordPress.slack.com #forums channel. Sometimes I messaged a bit of a conversation.

- I read some very technically difficult plugin support forum threads. Tough, but I like a challenge!

- I replied to one continued thread about "Gold Price" plugin and “Custom Stock Widget” plugin (Link: <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/new-price/#post-8688902">https://wordpress.org/support/topic/new-price/#post-8688902</a> )

- I curated and pruned my rss feed to narrow it to plugins that I can more easily understand. Unfortunately, this is taking way more time than I had anticipated.

- I followed some plugins of local (Boston) Plugin devs.

- I learned about internationalization of a WordPress Plugin, and plan to write a blog post about it. (See: "How to Internationalize and Localize a WordPress Plugin" (<a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2017.php?2017-01-28#2017-01-28">http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2017.php?2017-01-28#2017-01-28</a>))

- This also precipitated (and was preceded by) creating a hello world plugin and blogging about it. (See: "Hello World Plugin for WordPress" (<a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2017.php?2017-01-27#2017-01-27">http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2017.php?2017-01-27#2017-01-27</a>))

- I started to feel self-conscious saying hi and by every day on the wordpress.slack.com #forums channel. So I started to move instead to doing so once a week, and then on the other days by mostly just reading an hour's worth of scrollback, and adding some reactive emojis to what other people have written.

- On Jan 30, I read this one forum post "PHP Warning" (<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-warning-112/#post-8698586">https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-warning-112/#post-8698586</a>). I liked that the symptom was resolved. Also I found the related Github bug fix which was viewable publicly on github.com. In other words, I was glad to be able to transparently see not only the support thread, but also the coding (development) thread! (related github thread: <a href="https://github.com/yikesinc/yikes-inc-easy-custom-woocommerce-product-tabs/pull/55">https://github.com/yikesinc/yikes-inc-easy-custom-woocommerce-product-tabs/pull/55</a> )

- Also on Jan 30, I saw that the "company-updates-for-linkedin" plugin has some activity -- a person asking for support! (Here: <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/change-date-formatting/">https://wordpress.org/support/topic/change-date-formatting/</a>) Thus I've bookmarked it, and when I get my bookmark system figured out and I get a chance, I want to take a look to see if I can help support, and thus learn about developing this plugin.

- On Jan 31, I read this thread in the "jquery-pin-it-button-for-images" plugin support forum, and have set a bookmark for revisiting it. (This: "Pin it hover not showing up on featured image in recipe" <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pin-it-hover-not-showing-up-on-featured-image-in-recipe/">https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pin-it-hover-not-showing-up-on-featured-image-in-recipe/</a>)

- On the last few days of the learning project, I was still comfortable with mostly just reading threads.

- By the last day, I was waffling and starting to lean more towards wanting to find a way to reply to more threads and have a bullet-proof bookmarking system.


In conclusion, this has been my Final Report of what happened, and what I learned, during my 2017-01-20 WordPress Plugin Developer Work-project.

My Career Path Over the Next Few Years

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

My ideal career path over the next few years is to maintain a role where my performance directly impacts my company, and in turn, where the value my company provides to clients is measurable and substantial.

I also want to nurture work relationships with professional colleagues who keep high standards, ongoing.

That's it.

Looking back, this career goal statement hasn't changed an awful lot over the past couple of years. I think it's because it's so high-level. But that's the point-- it's an overarching goal; like a mission statement. I like to check back on it every so often, to re-inspire myself on where I should be steering my career.

Here's a link to an old version, from 2015:

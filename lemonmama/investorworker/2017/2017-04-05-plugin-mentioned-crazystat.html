Thrilled for my Plugin to Have Been Mentioned on blog.christosoft.de

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I use CrazyStat script, and also phpLiteAdmin script. By the people behind christosoft.de

Therefore I was thrilled that I was mentioned there!

I'm really glad that the persona of Christopher Kramer included this mention and this link. Thanks to them!

It was also nice of them ( <a href="https://twitter.com/Christosoft_en">https://twitter.com/Christosoft_en</a> ) to tweet at me to mention that they had done this -- indeed, I probably wouldn't have known about it without having see the twitter notification that this had been tweeted at me! So double-thanks to them. :)

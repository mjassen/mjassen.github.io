Scarcity and Abundance and Academic Lifetime Accumulation

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

This blog post is about some ways to address academic performance fears, professional performance fears, and life fears.

In short, the below ideas can be summarized as this: to begin to solve a scarcity mindset problem, I can stretch/exercise, plan, aim for financial independence, and so can tune into an abundance mindset which allows me to start beyond scarcity.

(Note: I'm not a doctor and don't claim to be able to diagnose true anxiety or depression, so please if that is a concern then see a doctor!)

Right-- first, define the problem.

Here's a basic definition of the problem: One has a habit of dwelling on long stretches of stress and anxiousness, including fear of failing in academic performance, and fear of losing one's job. Myself included first.

What's a solution?

Unfortunately, it can't be blamed on the traditional United States (American) school and exam systems (including featuring cumulative grading systems and GPAs and exam scores) that were designed in the industrial age, that promote competitive scarcity, and that train people in the employee (worker) mindset; even if these are largely true, it the problem can't be blamed on them.

It's still got to be the responsibility of the individual to deal with such fears, and start at a point that is past such stressors. Why? Because one can't change the school system or the industrial age mindset overnight, however, one can change one's own attitude overnight. Starting with me.

Yes, it turns out that anyone can, at any point, tune into abundance.

Moving on.

How to solve the problem of some forms of stress and anxiousness, related to failing in school and at work -- what's a good solution?

I read some abundance mindset -themed blog posts, and also "Rich Dad"* (book series) concepts.

From initial reading, to get past the stress, anxiousness, and scarcity, I realize I want to move away from scarcity mindset, and towards abundance mindset.

Correction: One blog article I read said something like: (paraphrasing) '...one doesn't get past scarcity, one starts beyond it...'

So what I want, then, is to start beyond scarcity.

Inspiring. Its's a mindset, so it needs to be addressed via intelligence, not via physical exertion.

I can meditate. (Sit and do nothing -- sit for 10 minutes, or as long as I can, and let my mind wander -- tell my friends if they ask, that I "need to rest for a while").

I can meditate, breathe, and be mindful.

I can plan each week out ahead of time, and I can focus on what's truly important, rather than what's urgent-yet-unimportant. (à la "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"** (book))

I can write a daily journal note of what I already have, for which I'm grateful.

I can give and share what I have (or a part of it), and that may help me realize that I have more than I had thought.

I read that physical fitness also helps with stress and anxiousness, so I can start doing yoga stretches, walking, and any other simple exercises.

Rich-Dad (Kiyosaki)'s persona, towards becoming wealthier and living a better life, touts training in self-discipline, exercising one's brain, and aiming for what we call "financial independence". So I can aim for that too.

In conclusion, to begin to solve a scarcity mindset problem and to start past scarcity, I can stretch, plan, exercise, and aim for financial independence, and so can tune into an abundance mindset.

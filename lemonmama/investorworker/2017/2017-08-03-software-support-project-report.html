Final report for Software Technical Support Work-project for weeks 29 & 30 (2017)

By author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

Here's what I did in this two-week-long software technical support work-project sprint:

1.)
I went to WordCamp Boston 2017 ( <a href="https://2017.boston.wordcamp.org">https://2017.boston.wordcamp.org</a> ) and talked with people there about WooCommerce and about WordPress. On Suday the 23rd, I participated in contributor day. Which resulted in me responding to threads about general/core WordPress support. Here's a link to a chat log from that day, regarding this:
<a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQC6RW/p1500830248100953">https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/...953</a> (A (free) Slack account is required to view this link – see: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat">https://make.wordpress.org/chat</a> )

2.)
Made replies on these forum threads:

Review of October 2016 Boston WP Meetup Video by Publisher Tom Beach with Presenter Eileen Lonergan

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

Following the persona of Tom Beach on <a href="http://bostonwp.org/news/">http://bostonwp.org/news/</a> (where I have seen them habitually/regularly publish in the past), I came across this blog post (the feature of which is an October meetup talk video)

"Divi Theme and the new Divi Theme Builder" (<a href="http://bostonwp.org/2016/09/october-2016-meetup/">http://bostonwp.org/2016/09/october-2016-meetup/</a>)

I watched the video. It was about using the Divi Theme Builder to build (a) WordPress website(s), including some tips and tricks of what to watch for, and what one might want to implement when building a site. I enjoyed the talk, and I commented my specific thoughts on the post, in the comments section of the post.

In my comments on the blog post, I thanked the people involved for sharing this video. (Speaker, publisher, etc.) I wrote that I enjoyed the format of the talk. I noted that I also enjoyed seeing the part of the video that included the discussion after the talk, and talked about building client websites and using the Divi theme.

(Update: My comment(s) can bee seen at the bottom of the above-referenced blog post! (Thus, thanks also to the site admin for having let my comment through!))

Description of Stepwise Process Resulting in a Significant Web Development Accomplishment

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

A significant web development accomplishment was when I worked with a colleague on a barcode-scanning web application.

I was tasked to create a web app that read and wrote from and to the SQL Server database, and allowed a user to scan barcodes on packages.

I wrote out a multi-step, bullet-pointed high level plan for the application. Then I reviewed the plan with my supervisor, and made some revisions.

Next, I implemented the program, writing the HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL to achieve each step of the plan, referencing my written plan as I went, and testing as I went.

Partway through my supervisor asked me to work with a colleague on part of the program, and allowed us to figure out how to work together. I was glad for the help, and shared with my colleague my write-up of remaining to-do items.

My colleague helped by implementing (writing and testing) a JavaScript-powered module that validated a part number and contained logic to sound an alarm sound through the computer speaker in the case of an invalid part number.

I called the JavaScript module from the main program. I tested it and used it.

This project was significant for me because by using the steps/process detailed above, I was able to create the program that had been specified, and was able to work with my supervisor and colleague to progress the project.

Thoughts on Web Performance Blog Post on Wayfair Engineering Blog

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

Intro: Wayfair HQ is in Boston, and the company has a reputation for PHP Web Development, as well as a reputation for periodically hosting an in-person tech meetup, like via the meetup.com Boston PHP meetup group.

On LinkedIn (see (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/hp/update/6217069526832410624">https://www.linkedin.com/hp/update...624</a>)), I saw the below link, from it having been Liked and Shared. Thanks to the Author, Sharer, and Liker for having shared this where the internet (and I) could see it:

This link, to the blog post: "Upgrading our stack for web performance: early flushing, http/2, and more"
(<a href="http://engineering.wayfair.com/2016/12/upgrading-our-stack-for-web-performance-early-flushing-http2-and-more/">http://engineering.wayfair.com/2016/...-http2-and-more/</a>)

What are my take-aways after having read the blog post?

- I will put the post Author persona of Ben Clark on my list of authors to follow to learn about Web Engineering. (<a href="http://engineering.wayfair.com/author/bclark/">http://engineering.wayfair.com/author/bclark/</a>)

- I'm inspired that the team's goal was such a high level one, that aimed at such a fundamental performance improvement. Inspired, because of the foresight it takes to invest substantial resources and time towards something that is behind-the-scenes.

- I was glad to see that their solution borrowed from the solutions of other Web Engineers (references to three particular engineers are cited in the article)

- Finally, I was glad that their solution was written up, including screenshots, so that I could read, see, and learn about it.

Plan for 2017-01-20 WordPress Plugin Developer Open Source Volunteer Work-project

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I'm back at it again!

(For history, see "Plan for 2016-04-10 to 2016-05-10 Open Source Volunteer Software Development and Support Engineer “Mentorship” ( Job-shadow / Informational-interview / Work-project )" (<a href="http://wieldlinux.com/2016.php?2016-04-10#2016-04-10">http://wieldlinux.com/...#2016-04-10</a>))

This post outlines the plan for a learning/growth project for me. The goal is for me to work with plugin users towards solving their problems on the WordPress.org support forums (see my link to my profile here: <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mjjojo">https://profiles.wordpress.org/mjjojo</a>), and to, in a structured way via this volunteer work, to myself grow and learn about WordPress Plugin Development. Here are the details:

Starting 2017-01-20, for two weeks duration, for at least 30 minutes' time per each weekday, I’ll:

Daily (weekdays), check in on the wordpress.slack.com #forums channel. (Say hi, be social. Don’t be shy. Thus I can learn from my peers, and them from me. )

Daily, do the work! (Read & Write — read & reply to a thread on the <a href="http://WordPress.org/support">http://WordPress.org/support</a> forums, more specifically, focus limited to support in the below-listed* plugin support forums.

On the final day, after two weeks, write and blog the “Final report”. This should be a list of bullet points, or a list of paragraphs, whenever possible including details (links and dates+times etc.) describing what happened during the Work-project, and what I learned.

One week before the final day, I will update this post with a note of whether or not I'm planning on extending the project for a further two weeks.

This has been a description of my plan for a 2017-01-20 WordPress Plugin Developer Open Source Volunteer Work-project. I’ll see you on the forums on the chat! And look for my follow-up blog post “final report” on the last day.

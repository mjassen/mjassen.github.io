What I've Seen in A Recent Month in the WordPress Web Developmer Ecosystem

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

What I saw (in the last month leading up to Jan 22nd,2017) in the WordPress ecosystem.

I learned the WP-API is really gaining traction. I think I heard guests on two or three different podcasts mention it. One was definitely mentioned in an episode of OfficeHours.fm, and another was definitely The ShopTalk Show.

From PluginTut podcast, the "WP Event Calendar WordPress plugin interview" ( <a href="https://plugintut.com/wp-event-calendar-wordpress-plugin-interview/">https://plugintut.com/wp-event-calendar-wordpress-plugin-interview/</a> ) episode with the persona of JJJ, I learned that they have authored a lean Event Calendar plugin. It's inspiring for me to find a smaller-sized plugins like this, that I have a better chance of understanding and supporting.

I was doing support replies on general forums and on my favorite plugin support forums for most of the month. Then at the end of the month, into my RSS feed reader app, I added links to support feeds for plugins of companies that I admire such as Automattic, 10up, Slocum studios, Modern Tribe, and a handful of others. In adding these feeds, the idea is to focus on plugins that each already have an ecosystem (read: a company) backing them to some extent.

I participated noticeably on the #forums slack chat. I often daily wrote "Hi!..." to tell everyone I came, and "bye!..." to let everyone know I went.

In conclusion, the above are some details of what I saw, learned and did, in the month leading up to Jan 22nd, 2017, in the WordPress ecosystem.

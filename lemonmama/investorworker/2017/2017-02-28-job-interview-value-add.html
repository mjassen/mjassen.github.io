How to Turn a Job Interview Process into some Additional Direct Value

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I think a great way to turn an already challenging job interview process into a project with some direct, additional value, is to write a blog post on my experience(s) during the process.

How? An example is that one time I did a coding challenge for a job application. I wrote it up as a blog post. Here: "Challenge - How to Serialize a String to JSON in PHP" (<a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php?2016-11-22#2016-11-22">http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php?2016-11-22#2016-11-22</a>)

A note is that I don't have to name names, and I don't have to reveal private information while doing this. I don't even have to say that the reason I'm doing the challenge is for a job interview. (oops, I just did!)(Ha ha! but that's the point of this here blog post.)

More on this is that, often, and for many people by default even, I don't necessarily want to tell the world that I'm currently applying to a company. This could be out of courtesy to the company or another third party/company. Therefore, by default I may leave the company's name out of the blog post, and just say that the post is about something I learned while applying for "a job", and/or I may write a post about something I learned about a company and leave out the fact that I am applying for a job with company.

In conclusion, it takes effort to go through a challenging job interview process, and there's no guarantee that I'll have anything to show for it, however if I write a blog post about my experience, then that means every time I'll have something valuable to show for the experience -- the blog post!

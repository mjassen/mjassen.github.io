Thoughts on Reading About a Professional's Career History

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

While checking out (reading) blog posts for the 2016 Supportdriven.com 6-week blogging challenge, I read the blog post: "Support Driven Writing Challenge: History" (Oct 31, 2016 • Rachel Berry) ( <a href="http://cmrberry.com/blog/2016/sd-history/">http://cmrberry.com/blog/2016/sd-history/</a> )

One high-level take-away from this is that I'm glad to read this sweeping history of someone else's career that seems to cover at least 12 years (~ish) of their career. When looked at this way, it seems tumultuous. But while reading, I'm thinking that my own career history isn't that different -- it's tumultuous. Life happens at the same time as career is changing. Thanks to the author for having written this.

Some Comments on Episode 15 of the PluggedIn Radio Podcast

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I listened to Episode 15 of the PluggedIn Radio Podcast:

"LifterLMS Learning Management plugin for WordPress" <a href="https://plugintut.com/lifterlms-learning-management-plugin-wordpress/">https://plugintut.com/lifterlms-learning-management-plugin-wordpress/</a>)

I encountered this podcast after having listened to the Matt Report podcast, and after having gone to a WordPress Rhode Island meetup many months back. I'm interested in tuning back in because the PluggedIn Radio podcast topics have to do with WordPress Plugins.

I enjoyed listening. Thanks to the host and guest for having shared this!

Here are some of my take-aways after having listened.

At 18min.50sec. into the podcast, the host has just mentioned that he authored, and uses, a WordPress plugin called "Easy Support Videos". (Link/reference: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-support-videos/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-support-videos/</a>)

Then they go on to say, and this is what made me smile, that they usually use the Easy Support Videos plugin to embed *Wistia* videos into the WordPress admin area.

I especially loved this, because as I wrote before, I have in the past a habit of following (The Company of) Wistia. For example my past post: "Buildium Boston Combines Forces with Wistia Cambridge to Publish Customer Success Story" <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php?2016-11-19#2016-11-19">http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2016.php?2016-11-19#2016-11-19</a>

Also, I'm glad to have learned about LMS and LifterLMS from this episode of PluggedIn Radio podcast. I was amazed to hear that the guest on the podcast could sell "How to make an omelet" lessons online for $20 each! It was an aside, and the host and guest had a chuckle about it, including at the very end of the podcast. However, it really brought the point home that there can be money to be made in the world of online learning.

I also liked hearing a bit about the world of LMS in general. I had heard from someone that LMS is hot these days, but didn't know much about it. Now I know of at least one platform, LifterLMS, that is built off of WordPress, but that also has a yearly-subscription support plan.

I'll likely continue to follow PluggedIn Radio for another episode. Thanks again to those involved in making and sharing the podcast!

In conclusion, I liked this episode of PluggedIn Radio podcast because of the reference to Wistia, but also because I learned a bit about online learning systems.

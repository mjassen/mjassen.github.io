How to Unmount Usb Flash Drive on Ubuntu via Keyboard Commands

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I recently found myself without a mouse temporarily but I needed to remove my usb flash drive immediately before doing anything else. That raised the question:

How to unmount usb flash drive on Ubuntu via keyboard commands?

Here's step-by-step of what did it for me.:

(note, when typing these commands, don't type the words: "user@box:~$ ". That represents the terminal prompt; start typing the command after that. )

1.)
At terminal prompt, type:
user@box:~$ mount

, which shows us the following output:
>"...
>/dev/sdb1 on /media/SILVERDISKY type vfat...
>..."

, which shows us where the usb flash drive is mounted. (in this example we see it's at /dev/sdb1 )

2.)
At terminal prompt, type:
user@box:~$ udisks --unmount /dev/sdb1

3.)
At terminal prompt, type:
user@box:~$ udisks --detach /dev/sdb

That's it! Those are the commands that worked for me to safely unmount usb flash drive on Ubuntu.

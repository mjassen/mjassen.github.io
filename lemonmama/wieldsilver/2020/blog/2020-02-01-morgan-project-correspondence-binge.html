<h2>Project for 2020 Weeks 06 and 07 - Email Correspondence Binge with Colleagues and Associates</h2>
<h2>規劃出2020週數06與07的項目 - 和一些夥伴連續地通信</h2>

This is a two-week growth and learning project.


~~~ Project Plan

- In this two week project sprint, I'll email a colleague or associate, possibly 1x different person per day, possibly someone who is local, possibly someone who we share a common target-project, to ask what they're working on, and/or share what I'm working on. In other words, networking very deliberately. Who knows what I'll learn? What accords I'll make or strengthen? (What animosities I'll inadvertently make or propagate?)

- After the two-week project, I'll blog a “Final report”.



[ 2020-02-15 Update:

~~~ Project Final Report

In this 2-week sprint I did:

- Corresponded and conversed with associates.


In this 2-week sprint I learned:

- Preparing to write someone a message *makes you think about that person*. A.k.a. it simply builds consideration.

- A great value in correspondence is about relationship building and about realizing the value in one's existing ongoing relationships. 

- The topic of correspondence will be different for each pair of associates, and may focus on what the pair has in common. (common values/mission/projects)

- One practicing reaching out to others, begets one more noticing *when others ask one how one is doing*. 


Ok, so then why is this relevant to the mission of w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶?

Why is this relevant to journey-to-Financial-Independence and using interest to pay for vacations?

Before this weeks 6&7 project I may have only said I felt it was essential. After this project in hindsight I say it's relevant because for me, I'm personally weak in the areas of consideration, relationship-maintenance and building, general skills, and personal skills. A.k.a. general competency and professionalism or transferable skills. And I believe that in order to succeed in any one specialized area (in this case, money-investing and vacation-funding), I must first maintain my general competency skills at least a minimum viable level (or bring these skills up to at least a minimum level.)

Thus this earthling finds that on the path to so-called financial independence, this earthling's main blocks to success in money-investing, are actually their weaknesses in general competency. And that's why this is relevant to journey-to-Financial-Independence and using interest to pay for vacations.


In conclusion, in this project-sprint, I built my capacity for consideration for others.

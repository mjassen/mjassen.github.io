Families and Kids Should become Financially Independent

A way towards this is for families and kids to participate in company ownership. 

This works well too because if the family owns the company, they are free to invite the kids to help.

Also adults and kids can learn about money together while working on and in a company together.

I envision a scenario where all the owners, and the employees or contractors, of a company, are family-frienddly.  

Contractors instead of employees may especially well-suited to this as the contractors could also take the form of companies which are also family-friendly.

Why is ^this so inspiring? Because the people involved are owners of their own company, and the people involved are also all free to bring their family and kids along. Everyone owns, profits, works, and learns.

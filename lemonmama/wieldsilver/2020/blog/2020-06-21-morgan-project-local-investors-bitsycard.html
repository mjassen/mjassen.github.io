2020-06-21 by author Morgan Jassen on <a href="https://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶">w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶</a>


~~~ Start Project Plan

- In this one week project sprint, I'll collaborate with compeers at a local investing meetup.

- I'll also work on my own bitsycard project.

- After the week-long project, I'll update the “Final report” section of this blog post.

~~~ End Project Plan



~~~ Start Final Report

I did:

- Went to the investing meetup, it was good. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Investing-Meetup-Group">https://www.meetup.com/Investing-Meetup-Group</a>

- Worked on bitsycard project. <a href="">https://b̶i̶t̶s̶y̶c̶a̶r̶d̶.̶c̶o̶m̶</a>


I learned:

- Bitsycard project still needs more iterations. Haven't yet maintained understanding the "why" of the project. Why will people like to make, sell, buy cute cards?



~~~ End Final Report

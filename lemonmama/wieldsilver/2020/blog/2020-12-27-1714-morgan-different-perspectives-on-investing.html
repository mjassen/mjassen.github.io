Different Perspectives on Investing

I.)
Person 1:
“how do you buy stocks?” 
Person 2: 
“it’s the same as buying groceries at the grocery store-- you pay money, then get the stock...” 
Person 1:
“so like you put the stocks on the conveyor belt and then the clerk scans it and puts it in the bag?” 
Person 2: 
(Realizes freshly that buying stocks, there really is a degree of physical abstraction) 


II.)
(Upon watching Understanding Investments¹ video.)
Person 2:
...(Pauses and then restarts the video some times during watching) ...
Person 1:
“ha ha ha he looks funny when you pause it! His mouth is always open... his eyes are closed! ... ha ha ha!”  
Person 2:
See?, investing is fun...!

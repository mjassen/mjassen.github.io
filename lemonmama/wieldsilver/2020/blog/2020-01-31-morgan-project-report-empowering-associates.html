<h2>Final report for Project for weeks 04 & 05 (2020) - Through my Work Project Empowering my Associates</h2>

2020-01-31 by author Morgan Jassen on <a href="https://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶">w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶</a>



For this two-week work project sprint, I meditated daily on how to, with others, find, execute, and cultivate good projects that make an economic difference.

This included meditating daily on general ideas like:

- Looking for a project.
- Defining what is a good project.
- Helping others look for a project.
- Cultivating a project vs. finding a project.
- How to find who to work with? (a.k.a. "Looking for associates")
- Executing a project vs. looking for a project.
- Finding venues for a colleague search.
- Finding venues for a project search.
- How to approach an associate with the goal of learning what their current project is?
- How to connect two other associates to a (their) common project?
- How to find a project under a win-win paradigm?
- How to execute a project under a win-win paradigm?
- Looking for a project that makes an economic difference.
- To a project the value of ROI (Return on Investment).
- The idea of an "open organization".

Ok, so then why is this relevant to the mission of w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶?

Why is this relevant to journey-to-Financial-Independence and using interest to pay for vacations?

It's relevant because companies create interest (profit, dividends, etc.) by completing a project. In order to understand which company to buy, I must understand how companies of people find, execute, and cultivate good projects.

In conclusion, in this two week sprint, I meditated on ^these things.

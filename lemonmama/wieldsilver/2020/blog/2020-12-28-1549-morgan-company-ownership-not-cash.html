Rich in the Sense of Company Ownership Value not Cash Money Value

“...money; we had massive amounts of stock. ...” 

^ On the Secrets of Wealthy Women Wall Street journal podcast*, the persona of Carol Lavin Bernick says this about Alberto V05 / Unilever family business. Says that their family cared about the business relatively much and at some points along the way they weren't relatively rich in terms of money. Instead she indicates important was growing or maintaing the company or the company ownership.

This is inspiring because it reinforces the idea that rich people aren't always rich in the sense of they have a lot of cash or they think having cash is important. In this example there was a lot of value in company ownership.

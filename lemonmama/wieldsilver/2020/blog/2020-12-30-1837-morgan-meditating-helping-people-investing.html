Meditating Helping People with Investing

Thought exercise, how to help integrating life with helping others with investing.

Mission:
Why: Empowering earthlings
How: Surfing Financial Independence
What: Owning Local Businesses

Thus business mission is: "Empowering earthlings through surfing financial independence by owning local businesses."

So for example help a person be empowered by helping them towards financial independence by helping them own a local business in our city.

...but thinking again, people generally don't want, or don't know they want, to be empowered, nor want financial independence. This isn't a common want or isn't highest on folks' list of wants.

They may instead they think they want "to spend more time with family" or want "A new car" or just want "to get awesome numchuck skills".

However if they were empowered with financial independence, whether they know it or not, getting ^these things would be MUCH easier.

Thus I can help by:

Helping the person get time with family AND financial independence, for example help them own a company in my city thats business is spending time with family.

or
Helping the person get a new car AND financial independence, for example help them own a company in my city thats business is new cars.

or
Numchuks skills AND financial independence, for example help them own a company in my city thats business is numchuck skills.

In conclusion, how about looking for ways to help people towards their wants, _at the same time as_ owning their own business, ongoing?

<h2>One Percent Per Month Family Investment Strategy</h2>

Awesome new investment strategy.

Empowers.

Empowering investment idea for families.

In short: empower 1 family member each month to put 1% of the familys investment portfolio ( this == 1.25% of the family’s yearly income) per month into whatever stock (or investment) they want.

Thus for example in march sis decides to put 1% of the fams investment funds into her favorite bond. 
Then in april mom puts 1% to her favorite stock. 
Then bro in may puts ( or shifts) 1% to his current favorite real estate loan borrow deal. 
Then dad in june moves 1% to his favorite stock. 
Repeat. 
Repeat monthly.

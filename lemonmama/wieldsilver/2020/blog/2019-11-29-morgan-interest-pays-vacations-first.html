[ Start 2021-11-22 Update:
Now about two years later, I've realized that vacationing is an extremely emotional hot-button topic for a lot of folks. 
Which I hadn't realized when writing this first in 2019.
Live and learn.
I'll just leave this here. 
However, what this means is the focus of this blog may want to be something else. 
And now in hindsight, in November 2021 the blog has changed from "wieldsilver.com" to "wieldsilver.lemonmama.com" and also the focus has shifted less laser-focused on "using interest to pay for vacationing with friends" more to general life wisdom topics and investing topics. 
Also the monetary units have shifted from "silver-grams" to "Silver Bams (₷¤)". And more.
End 2021-11-22 update. ]

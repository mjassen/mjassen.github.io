<h2>What Do You Call Just Starting to Change a Habit</h2>

What do you call just starting to change a habit?

I need a word for what happens just after one starts to change one’s bad habit towards the better, but before the new good habit has been established.

There is a space or gap, a verb there, that may be perceived as a dip. 
And it's a scary place. 
It's a dynamic place. 
People are afraid of change, it is said. 
This gap, and navigating this gap, is right there.
 
But it's necessary to go through this gap, this verb, in order to maintain or improve one’s character.

I'll call it "grabit" because you're grabbing on to a new habit. Maybe Kaizen. But does Kaizen describe the precariousness and the fear?

A Secret of Successful Media Programs

One “secret” of successful media is that it focuses on diverse life topics *but through a narrower lens*.
 
For example I like the Secrets of Wealthy Women podcast (WSJ Podcasts) because it is self-described about money but also because it is self-described narrowed in focus towards a smaller group i.e. women. 

But in reality the meat of the content varies widely and diversely on many life topics, and merely filter these through a “lens” of wealthy women lens.

Another example is OurSQL podcast— it focused through the lens of MySQL but really touched on a broad range - tech industry, linux, rdbms, general career professionalism, women in tech, professionl conferences, podcasting, system administration, etc etc.

<h2>Project Plan for 2020 Weeks 04 and 05 - Through my Work Project Empowering my Associates</h2>

2020-01-23 by author Morgan Jassen on <a href="https://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶">w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶</a>

This is a plan for a two-week growth and learning project for weeks 04 & 05 of 2020.

In the "Financial Freedom" book¹ on money topics, the author persona Suze Orman advises to ultimately put people before money.


- In these two weeks I will learn about “Through my Work Project Empowering my Associates”. In other words at work adding value by helping my colleagues and clients.

- After the two-week project, I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during the project, and what I learned. (This report will be based on daily journal entries that I kept during the two-week project.)

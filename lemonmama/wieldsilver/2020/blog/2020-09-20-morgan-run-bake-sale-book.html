<h2>Review of Run Your Own Bake Sale¹ (book) by Berne</h2>

This book is a gem! it is about 30 pages long, each page has pictures and a paragraph of text or two.

The book is a step-by-step recipe on how run a bake sale and to be an entrepreneur, aimed at kids.

But the book is just about the right level (and length) for me.

This is because I am still starting out as an entrepreneur.

I recommend this book for anyone starting out as an entrepreneur or thinking of ideas how to make money or start a business.

Side notes:
- The book's title is similar (only off by a couple words)(and also actually the content same at a very high level) to “Own Your Own Corporation” ² which is another favorite of mine. 

- This Run Your Own Bake Sale book is one of six similar books in a series. The others are how to run a: *Babysitting Business, *Car Wash, * Recycling Business, *Yard Sale, and *Yard-Work Business.

Those are next on my list!

How to buy Starbucks Company in June 2021?


~~~ Project Plan

- In this two week project sprint, I ask, "How can I buy 112 silver-grams† of Starbucks company?"

- So my idea is I buy a company with my hard earned money, then the company pays for stuff. I also want everyone else to use this idea too, if they wish to themselves. 
For example right now I'm sweet on Nike (NKE) or Starbucks (SBUX) or T-Mobile (TMUS), so this fortnight I say I want to buy Starbucks stock shares.

But how? I got other stuff to do like working at my day job, exercising to keep healthy, figuring out how to navigate a pay raise, and saving money by not drinking too much actual Starbucks coffee(ironic right?).

So then how can I afford 112 silver-grams of Starbucks company?

- During the two week project sprint I'll write in my journal. At the end I'll update the “Final report” below.


~~~ Final Report

Here's what happened: 

Sadly I didn't buy SBUX shares.
There was a lot pulling on my life.
One thing I hit against is that I'd say 90% of people, including some close friends and family, see investing as risky and/or gambling. 
I realized many folks in my circles may not distinguish between short term trading and long term investing either, but again rather tend to bucket all of these as gambling/risky.
I did start reading "The Psychology of Money" (book by Morgan Housel) though.

In conclusion, it's hard to invest. Because people are more important than money, and people are funny about money. 
And even though investing isn't gambling (Lottery tickets are gambling. Sports betting is gambling. Long-term stock investing isn't gambling.) But nonetheless, in the long term (say 10 years and more) i still see it as not an option to not start investing and not an option to not keep investing. Baby steps. Onwards!

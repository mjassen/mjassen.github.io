One Iteration Paradigm and Multiple Iterations Paradigm

Two distinctly different mindsets (paradigms) for viewing life and getting things done.

1.) 
Moreso that there is only one iteration with any given thing (goal, project, task etc) and we must always keep going with that one iteration.

2.) 
Moreso that we can always iterate multiple times at the same thing (goal, project, task etc).

^ This is amazing.

And this is highly leveraged by earthlings.

Sometimes people are in one paradigm and they don't even realize or recognize the other. 

And sometimes people know of both and leverage them to their advantage.

Or sometimes people know of both and effortlessly navigate between them for good.

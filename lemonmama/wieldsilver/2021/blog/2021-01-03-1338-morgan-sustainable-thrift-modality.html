How About Sustainable Thrift Modality

How about maintaining a sustainable thrift modality?

How about not letting money leave for un-necessary things, only for necessary things?

How about living frugally even while others nearby are living luxuriously?

How about the idea that one doesn't give cash to other people? 

Instead, how about understanding why other people would want you to give them cash, and then helping create substitutes for them better than cash?

How about not going on vacation until after cash flows in from interest?

• How about doing without the un-necessary thing?

• How about using home-made low-cost version instead of the necessary thing?

• How about using substitutes instead of the un-necessary thing?

• How about delaying /putting-off getting the un-necessary thing?

• How about using second-hand for the necessary thing?

• How about explaining openly to people why I'm choosing to not give money to be thrifty, and openly try to convert them to be thrifty with me too?

• How about explaining openly to people why I'm living frugally?

• How about being friends with thrifty people?

• How about having faith that I will be able to get to my goals, and sooner than I expect, and that grit and thrift will help with this?

How about in a direct competion scenario, people still come first and money second?

How about that, even in thrift mode, people still come first if it truly comes down to a survival scenario?

How about planning to avoid urgent survival scenario and advocating for people and money both at the same time?

How about, despite thrift mode, not centering on money nor thrift?

How about centering on all of: healthy stretching, healthy diet, and healthy stress-levels, money, and thrift?

How about centering on all of: working sustainably, family, spouse, money, and thrift?

How about centering on all of: community, investing, resting, money, and thrift?

How about centering on all of: friends, money, and thrift?

How about centering on combining these?

For example money aligns with family aligns with school aligns with work aligns with resting aligns with healthy diet aligns with excersising. 

And all easily accomplished without going into debt in any one area.

In conclusion, this blog post has been regarding thrift and wealth.

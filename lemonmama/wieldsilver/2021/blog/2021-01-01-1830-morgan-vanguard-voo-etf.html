<h2>Vanguard VOO ETF</h2>

On multiple independent trusted recommendations, I was recommended to invest in a reputable ETF that mimics the S&P 500 stock index.

One specific recommendation was the Vanguard VOO ETF.

One person said it has earned between (-5% to 20%) per year for the last couple decades or so.

And the yearly fee (this year) is ~0.03%.

Thus it looks good for me at this point to invest.


examples of .03%:
if I am investing 11,200 silver-grams† in a year then that year I pay 3.36 silver-grams in fees 
if I am investing 1,120 in a year then that year I pay .34 silver-grams in fees 
if I am investing 112 in a year then that year I pay .03 silver-grams in fees 



[2021-02-11 Update: Added the "examples of .03%" section at the end and the silver-gram valuation link at the footer.]

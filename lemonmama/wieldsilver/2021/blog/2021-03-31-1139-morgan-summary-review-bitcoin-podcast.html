In the podcast episode the host Kiyosaki says that business-ownership and real estate are how he makes his money.

In the podcast episode the guest Dixon says that when considering bitcoin, Dixon thinks in terms of buying currency (e.g. dollars) rather than in terms of selling bitcoin per se. (i.e. flipping the normal paradigm on its head)

<h2>Drinking Coffee at Home with Starbucks Cold Brew Concentrate from CVS</h2>

The question was where's convenient to get coffee?

The answer was CVS Pharmacy
<a href="https://www.cvs.com/store-locator/store-locator-landing.jsp">https://www.cvs.com/store-locator/store-locator-landing.jsp</a>

This coffee concentrate is convenient to drink coffee at home. I used this mixed 1:1 with water.

Starbucks Cold Brew Multi Serve Concentrate in Signature Black 32oz.
<a href="https://athome.starbucks.com/product/cold-brew-multi-serve-concentrate-signature-black/">https://athome.starbucks.com/product/cold-brew-multi-serve-concentrate-signature-black/</a>

No need to visit a cafe for coffee today.

I found this coffee concentrate at CVS Pharmacy for ~14.43 silver-grams† per 32oz. bottle.

However one downside to buying this coffee concentrate, it's 14 silver-grams less that I have to buy shares of CVS Health Corp(CVS) or to buy shares of Starbucks Corp(SBUX).

In conclusion, this was a story about where's convenient to get coffee.

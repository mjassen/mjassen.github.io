Thriving Now in Economic Bubble

People say we are in an economic bubble currently 2020.

So we are.

I also heard some say, iirc on a recent Rich Dad Radio Show* that's not all, but also, that we are actually in a depression but that government is pumping money in to cover that so it's not obvious to all.

So what opportunities does this offer?

We should invest in companies that will persevere and profit (now + during the upcoming depression + after the depression.)

So: 
A frugality oriented company. ¿
A resource sharing company. ¿ (Groupon? Ting mobile? Facebook classifieds? ... snd so on...)
A recycling company. ¿
A do-it-yourself home farming gardening company. ¿
A hardware store or fix-it-yourself supply store. ¿
A second-hand store or consignment shop. ¿

In conclusion, the questions remain -- what can we do to thrive through present and near future depression? Maybe invest in conservation company projects ongoing?

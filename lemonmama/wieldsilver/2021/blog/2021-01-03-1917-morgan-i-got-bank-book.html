<h2>Notes on reading “I Got Bank!” Book</h2>

In “I Got Bank!”¹ (book), the main character 10-year old, Jazz, has an interest sparked in money -- that he learned mostly from his granddad.

In the first few chapters, one focus is Jazz has normal 10-year-old and life problems.

At the same time another focus is Jazz's big financial concern is defending his bank account (a couple thousand dollars) from numerous people who want his money! Including his family members!

The reader learns that the young character Jazz has this serious real problem, and that Jazz knows it.

Readers will draw parallels between the essence of Jazz's concern, and their own concerns.

The author Williams in this book describes a life/money paradigm here.

A paradigm is, among close family, how do draw the line of whose money is whose?

And among close family, what (and whose) money should be used for what?

We readers may learn from the book and apply it to our own lives. 

In conclusion, these were notes on reading "I Got Bank" book.

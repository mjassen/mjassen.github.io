<h2>Friends Vacation Interest Vacation Friends</h2>

"Interest Pays for Vacations with Friends"* (blog post) says: 

"Interest ... Vacations ... Friends".

But it's slow and lonely.

Friends aren't interested in interest.

How to not fail?

Re-share the goal with the friends.

Make a new plan.

The goal is friends vacationing.

Have faith a new better plan will emerge.

Like Monica's boyfriend in "Friends" (show), who won't stop until he's the ultimate fighting champion.**

Not like Ellie and Carl in "Up" (movie), who never make it on vacation to Paradise Falls.***

In conclusion, who knows?

Maybe there's a better way than investment interest, to pay for vacations.

In the end, the vacation is more important than the money.

The friends are more important than the vacation.

w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ first post got it backwards.

It's not Interest Vacations Friends, it's Friends Vacations Interest.

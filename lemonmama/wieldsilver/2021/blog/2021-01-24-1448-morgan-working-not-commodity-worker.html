<h2>Working but Not a Commodity Worker</h2>

I dont want to moreso commoditize myself as a worker any longer. 

No one does, but I also don't want to either.

But I still want to do good work ongoing. 

If necessary I may do commodity work tasks too. This produces value.

BUT.

I don't want to aim to only do commodity work ongoing forward.

How?

So many employers look for commodity employees.

In short, I will change my resume and linkedin title to say high-level title of what i do.

As verbs not as nouns.

E.g. Instead of “Software support technician” I’ll now brand myself as:
“Analyzing, developing, and publishing” OR 
“Working and investing”, OR
“M̲organ O̲perates R̲allys G̲rubstakes A̲nd N̲aps”

I fully believe this will cause ~90% of potential employers to pass me by.

But I believe the remaining ~10% of potential employers are my tribe.

In conclusion, do good work but don't be a commodity worker.

<h2>IBM Red Hat Kubernetes Research and Commentary</h2>

Sometimes in order to buy or sell into a company or project, and even to prepare for the possibility of buying into a company or project, one needs to research.

I want to know about Red Hat.

I start to do a little homework.

Just in the last year or two it seems Red Hat was bought (understood relatively peaceably) by IBM.

And even looking at the stock ticker, if I recall just some months ago Red Hat had its own ticker symbol, but not any more. Now it just has a parent company ticker symbol if I understand:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat</a>
NYSE: IBM <a href="https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:IBM">https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:IBM</a>

Earlier this year I read "the Open Organization" (book by Whitehurst) and I really liked it. In fact I am trying to apply some of the principles to my life and to my current job (as allows)

But when I research Red Hat these days, it's not all just about Red Hat Linux OS. Which is what I thought of with the words "Red Hat"

I keep hearing like "OpenShift this..." and "...Kubernetes that", and "Containers this..."

I don't even know how to say "Kubernetes"!

In these contexts, I heard the slogan "Containers are linux".

Some questions I have are:
How does (do) OpenShift, Kubernetes, and Containers fit into or around Linux, or vice versa?

Enter: this podcast episode that I came across following red had folks on twitter:

---> "PodCTL - Enterprise Kubernetes - Building a Cloud-native Kubernetes Platform" <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/110399/2053731-building-a-cloud-native-kubernetes-platform">https://www.buzzsprout.com/110399/2053731-building-a-cloud-native-kubernetes-platform</a>

Now at the 12 minute mark of the 38-minute-long podcast episode, I'm  already getting some answers. And it's great to hear voices of the actual people involved in the project. (Plus now I know how to say "Kubernetes"!)

I learned from the podcast guest that Kubernetes can be described as the kernel of kubernetes solutions, just as the linux kernel can be described as the kernel of the Linux Operating system. In other words, Kubernetes is the center of a Kubernetes-based solution, but in order to have a whole functioning Kubernetes-based solution, one also needs for example (but not necessarily, but also not limited to) these:
* A Linux installation to install the Kubernetes solution onto.
* Containers to link into Kubernetes or to be a part of the Kubernetes solution
* Other components to link the first components together, or to link into them, like logging.

Then later in the podcast I learned that if I heard right, once a kubernetes solution is up and running, then on top of that or as part of that, it may run instances of RHEL OS.

Amazing, I learned a lot just listening to 12 minutes of this podcast, and I'm energized to understand Red Hat, the company, and the projects this much more!

In conclusion, this has been research and commentary on IBM (formerly Red Hat) company and its projects.

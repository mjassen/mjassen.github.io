Project Plan for 2019 Week 33 and 34

By author Morgan Jassen

This is a plan for a two-week growth and learning project for weeks 33 & 34 of 2019.

- Do strengthen my language ability in my target language.

- Do daily listen, speak, read, and/or write in my target language.

- Do work together in-person with another person on this project.

- At the end of the two-week project, do blog a “Final report” describing what happened during this project, and what I learned.

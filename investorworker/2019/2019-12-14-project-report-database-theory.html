Final report for Project for weeks 37 & 38 (2019) - Learn Database Theory

By author Morgan Jassen

In this two week sprint I did:

- Consumed video lessons and did exercises, learning about databases.

- Adjusted schedule to accommodate partner group-work demands. (Resting daytime, nap, up early, up late, bed late, bed early, etc.) 

- Created more than 8 ERDs from business rules.


In this two week sprint I learned:

- Realized despite having "read a lot of MySQL books" and worked with many real-world databases , there is a LOT I don't know about databases! Humbling at least, also exciting and applicable to real-life database work!

- Learned that particularly, time-scheduling this project was a challenge and put a strain on my sleep and personal-time schedule. But also learned that with some flexibility and determination, I could do lessons and do exercises, in a way integrated with my life.


In conclusion, in weeks 37 & 38 (2019), I learned about databases.

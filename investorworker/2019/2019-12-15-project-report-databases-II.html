Final report for Project for weeks 39 & 40 (2019) - Learn About Databases (II)

By author Morgan Jassen

In this two week sprint I did:

- Edited field type definitions.

- Used 'MySQL Workbench' app to manipulate database tables and data.


In this two week sprint I learned:

- Learned about physical vs. logical database design, SQL data types, and table schemas.

- Frustration came from misunderstood or unclear learning material. Primary method forward was to, with partner, iterate to understand, then move forward based on most likely correct meaning.

In conclusion, in weeks 39 & 40 (2019), I learned about databases.

<h2>Noting the Persona of Suze Orman Some Ideas About Money Fears</h2>

By Author Morgan Jassen

Liking the comments of the persona of author of Suze Orman in "Financial freedom" ¹ (Audiobook). Her persona in the audiobook advises not to fear money, and posits many people have childhood fears involving money which result in them avoiding money as adults.

For example at minute ~35:30 ( in the ~5hr.- long audiobook) the persona of Orman says: “those memories are controlling you”

The persona of Orman in the audiobook continues to talk about how like people should empower themselves around money, and gives tips how. 

This is different/new from other money literature I've read! -- This is (maybe not new to others, but) new to me -- good stuff.

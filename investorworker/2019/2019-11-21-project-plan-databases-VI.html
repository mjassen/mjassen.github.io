Project Plan for 2019 Week 47 and 48 - Learn About Databases (VI)

By author Morgan Jassen

This is a plan for a two-week growth and learning project for weeks 47 & 48 of 2019.

- In these two weeks I will “learn about databases”. (For a sixth consecutive project sprint)

- After the two-week project,  I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during the project, and what I learned.

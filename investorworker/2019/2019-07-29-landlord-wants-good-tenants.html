For a Real estate Investor it is Desirable to get Good Tenants

By author Morgan Jassen

This blog post points out that for a real estate investor it’s desirable to get good tenants, and that that’s a good thing.

From the mindset of a non-investor, non-landlord, one (myself included first, as relatively new to investing mindset) may busy oneself trying to _be_ a good tenant or present oneself as a good tenant, or trying to get a good apartment/lease. In other words, tenants want good units and landlords ideally.

However, in comparison to this, look at this article. In one paragraph is captured a viewpoint of a real estate investor: "...we get the best tenants when we have the best rental units. ..."

This article:

Thus we see that to a landlord/investor, the mindset (and the business/worries) are from a different perspective — landlords want good units and tenants ideally.

These paradigms can both be seen as good things, in that in either paradigm, the person is striving to be well, to present well, and to get good things. More power to both tenants and investors, for everyone to get a good real-estate agreement for all involved!

Thanks to the author(s) / persona(s) behind ^this massrealestate piece for having shared about this, It's great to hear about a point of view of a real estate property manager via this piece!

In conclusion, this blog post points out that for a real estate investor it’s desirable to get good tenants, and that’s a good thing.

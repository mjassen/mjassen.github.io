Posie's Burgers LLC Fictional Example of an LLC

By author Morgan Jassen

The point of this blog post is to simply, visually, depict a possible scenario wherein there can be two manager owners and two non-manager owners of a (burger restaurant) corporation (specifically an LLC).

This is meant mostly as a learning exercise, because visual pictures can help one to learn about financial investing and can help one to learn about financial concepts and topics!

Without further ado, here is a picture (drawing) of 2 manager owners, and 2 non-manager owners, in the context of "Posie's Burgers LLC" restaurant.

See my drawing here:

Note: the names and characters and scene are fictional and made-up, the point is to depict an actual example of a LLC structure/situation that would be possible or common to exist in the world at large.

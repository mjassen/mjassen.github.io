Hereby is invented what will be called initially “Dividend-only Investing”

"Dividend-only Investing" is here invented and defined as basically taking the production of dividends as the sole purpose of an investment. 

In other words the focused goal of "Dividend-only Investing" is to produce dividends, such as quarterly direct-stock dividends, and place exponentially less emphasis (close to none) on the principal cost. 

In other words it is an extreme long term investing mindset, so long term that in the mindset of a "Dividend-only Investing" investor, they are thinking that as the months and years and decades and generations and centuries go by, the dividends produced will so far overshadow the principal, that indeed the dividends are viewed as nearly priceless and the principal viewed as nearly negligible.

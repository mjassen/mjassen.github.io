Project Plan for 2019 Weeks 51 and 52 - Daydreaming and Meditating

By author Morgan Jassen

This is a plan for a two-week growth and learning project for weeks 51 & 52 of 2019.

- In these two weeks I will learn about “Daydreaming and Meditating”. In other words a time for "Sharpening the saw" activities, like reflecting & meditating & resting.

- After the two-week project,  I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during the project, and what I learned.

This post covers how to create a GPS track on gpsies.com and then download it as a ".gpx" file.

Note: for downloading the file, a (free as of this writing) gpsies.com account is needed.

Let's get this party started!


1.)
First, on Dell XPS Laptop on Windows 10, we launch Chrome browser.

2.)
Next, browse to <a href="https://www.gpsies.com">https://www.gpsies.com</a>

3.)
Next, from the main menu choose Create >> Track creator.

4.)
Next, we think of our plan -- we're planning on walking from BPL, across Boylston Street, to Dunkin' Donuts.

5.)
Next, we click on the map to create a starting point for the track, then we click at each point on the map along the way. This track is turning out pretty tiny -- only 7 track points total!

6.)
Next, click the "save" button near the upper-right above the map. Before clicking, note you may need to be logged in to gpsies.com (free account as of this writing) in order to save/download this/a track.

7.)
Next, fill the form to name and describe this gps track metadata. One of the choices to make is whether to make the track 'public' or 'private' Scroll down to the bottom and click "save" to save the filled form.

8.)
Next, when viewing the saved track, one may click the "download" button (in the "Download as ... GPX Track" dialogue box area)

9.)
Next, the file is downloaded to our desktop. We can view it in a map-viewer software that supports viewing .gpx files, or, view it as a plain text file (as depicted in this screenshot)

10.)
Finally, here is how the gps track looks when the same .gpx file is opened in a map-viewer software app:

Positive Money Awareness -- Book Review of Author Persona Carlson’s “Don't Sweat... Money” Book

By author Morgan Jassen

So far I'm really digging this book "Don't Sweat the Small Stuff About Money" ¹ by the persona of the author Richard Carlson, Ph. D.

19 pages in and it has talked about relaxing and not stressing, at the same time as dealing with money. 

One idea in the book is essentially that by far, more people worry about money than not. 
In other words, everyone whether rich or poor or in-between, worry about money, and that statistic points out that neither getting rich, alone, nor staying poor, alone, will stop the worry if you're a worrier. 
Thus it will be wise to in most cases keep the worry independent of the finances. 

Also already mentioned as well (this far into the book no less) is that this all (not *worrying* about money), isn't the same thing as not *caring* about money.
In other words, what the book is saying is that it's important for most everyone to mind one's money, but at the same time, it's also important for most everyone to not worry excessively over one's money. 

Also this book is organized in 100 short chapters, each like a 1-or-2 page essay. 
This is sweet for me, as I feel like I can pick the book up and read one chapter completely in 5 (or 3) minutes' time, and I will have learned something (even if I have to then put the book down for whatever reason)!

In conclusion, so far reading the "Don't Sweat the Small Stuff About Money" book, I do think is affecting my positive money awareness in a positive away, and so I do recommend (the first few chapters😉 of) this book in general for positive money awareness.

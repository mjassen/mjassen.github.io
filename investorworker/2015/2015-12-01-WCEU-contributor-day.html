WordCamp European Union (WCEU) Support Contributor Day Descends upon the WordPress.org Slack Chat Channel

The morning of Sunday 2015-06-28 I was unsuspectingly reading the forums and was signed into the https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/forums/

Then support contributor day started for WCEU. And they signed into slack chat as well. Even though it was an in-person meetup.

It was really great and neat to be a part of this software support team in live-time even though they were a continent apart from me.

Today is the Day that I Start Saving all my Passwords Into my Web Browser

Today is the day that I start saving all my passwords into my web browser.

This is it. Today is the day that I’m giving up typing my password in to every website every time, and logging out each time I’m done using a website.

It’s the normal thing to do. That’s the best reason I can give.

For years in the name of security and a sense of control or ownership, I’ve done my best to not store my password for my websites into my browser. I’ve made exceptions, for example my webmail which I check daily or multiple times per day. But now its time to always tell the browser to remember my password. It’s convenient. It’s productive, It saves time and it’s just the normal thing to do.

This is a way I’m growing and changing. This follows closely with switching to Chrome Browser (another normal thing to do) and coming back from a week vacation.

A Simple Measurable Way to Contribute to an Open Source Software Project

I realized a very simple way that I can contribute to an open source Open Source Software project. I can seed a torrent. (a Peer-to-Peer file-sharing torrent) For example I could seed the torrent for a Ubuntu 14 Desktop ISO:
http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent

I could seed the torrent for the LibreOffice v4.3.4 for Mac dmg (installer) file:
<a href="http://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/stable/4.3.4/mac/x86_64/LibreOffice_4.3.4_MacOS_x86-64.dmg.torrent">http://download.documentfoundatio...-64.dmg.torrent</a>

If my torrent client supports it I can even record/track how many MB I served/uploaded.

Seeding a peer-to-peer file share is a small but very real, very measurable way to contribute to an open source software project!

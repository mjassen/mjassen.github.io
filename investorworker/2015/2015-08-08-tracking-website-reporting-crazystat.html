Adding Tracking to Links back to WordPress-powered Website and Reporting on them with CrazyStat

I realized with my current setup, a WordPress-powered website with CrazyStat installed, ( see Description of how I installed CrazyStat on WordPress 3.9 ( http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/?p=52 )) I could with one more action (one more action each time I share a link) implement some tracking of whether-or-not the link was clicked by the person I shared it with.

I keep the setup the same as it is, but now each time I share a link that I want to track, I put some arbitrary tracking code added onto the end of the link that I share. For example, I want to share the link
w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/?page_id=1001

and afterwards I want to know whether or not the person clicked the link. I add
&track=hello

onto the end of the link, making it
http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/?page_id=1001&track=hello

Assuming the person clicks on the link, then I can see that fact afterwards in the CrazyStat report under the “Visits/File (a month’s time)” section in the upper right– if the unedited link was clicked then the “&track=hello” shows up there.

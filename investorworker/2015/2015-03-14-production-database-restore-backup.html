I just accidentally dropped one of my production databases because I thought I was logged into my developement database.

I dropped my checkingbalance database, while operating on it to write a blog post about it!

I do have a nightly mysqldump backup in place.  Now I need to physically go to where my backup driver is, get a copy of last night’s backup and restore the checkingbalance database, table and data from the backup,  before the nightly mysqldump overwrites the backup file again tonight.

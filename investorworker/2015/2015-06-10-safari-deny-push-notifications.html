Mac Safari how to Deny Push Notifications from a Website

I got a push notification from a website. I didn’t want that again.
I bing -ed
mac manage push notifications

Which came up with a link to this article which told me how to deny push notifications from the site in question:

“Mac 101: How to manage website Push Notifications in OS X Mavericks”
( http://www.tuaw.com/2014/05/21/mac-101-how-to-manage-website-push-notifications-in-os-x-maveri/ )

In short the way to do this is go into Safari > Preferences > Notifications tab and for any site Allowed there, instead set the radio button to “Deny”.

In a Spreadsheet How to Merge Cells so Multiple Cells Act Like One Spreadsheet Cell

I’m so excited that I learned how to do this. I learned this by getting a spreadsheet from someone. The spreadsheet had merged cells. I right-clicked in its properties and poked around and saw Merge cells was turned on. I turned it off and saw that the merged cell turned back into individual cells.

MS Excel: select multiple cells -> right-click and choose “format cells” -> alignment tab -> Text control section -> enable “Merge cells” checkbox.

LibreOffice: select multiple cells -> right-click and choose “Merge cells”.

That’s how to, in a spreadsheet, turn multiple spreadsheet cells into one spreadsheet cell.

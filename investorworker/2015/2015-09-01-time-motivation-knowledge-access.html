In IT to Solve an Issue I Need Time Motivation Knowledge Access and Tools

Posted on August 29, 2015

In IT to Solve an Issue I Need Time, Motivation, Knowledge, Access and Tools. I find that if I have these five (5) things (resources), or if I can get them, then I can solve an IT software issue.

If I had all five of these immediately or on-demand, then it would be only a matter of clicking through the mouse, keyboard or touchpad to configure the solution.

If I don’t have all of these five, or if I can’t get them immediately or on-demand, then I might never solve the issue.

– time

– motivation

– knowledge/information

– access/permission

– tools

So in my IT software job I spend much effort to get these five resources.

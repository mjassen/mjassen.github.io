Skype Brilliantly Asks if I Want to Update the Next Time I Start Skype

Skype this time did something different and brilliant. When I started skype it prompted me whether I want to install the new update the next time I quit skype. I like it! Because when I’m opening Skype chances are I want to use it right away. In any case if I can I’ll still most likely do the install the update and restart Skype immediately. But updating upon the next application-quit it just seems more friendly and smarter. As a user, I like to know that the update is available and be able to choose the option to do it either now or later. This new different behavior of the Skype updater is in that same spirit- I like the new behavior!

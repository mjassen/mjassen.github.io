not all databases need to be backed up nightly

note: originally published 2012-10-08 at a different domain name and url.

i had  a backup script to run mysqldump nightly to backup 7 databases.  then i added a database over a couple weeks time.  i wanted to back it up so i added it to the cron script list of databases.  but then i finished adding the database and , i realized it really was going to be a read-only database after it was done being built.  So then, the point of the story, i made a final backup of it.  the lesson here is that not all databases need to be backed up nightly — only databases that change on a daily basis need to be backed up nightly!  this seems obvious in hindsight, but, had not been to me until i finally realized it.

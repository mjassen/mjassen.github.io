Musings On Money And Respecting Money And Its Power

By author Morgan Jassen

In the past, I've largely had low respect for money. My mindset would largely be that of living within my means, and as long as my checkbook balance is zero and I have work income that offsets my monthly expenses then I'm fine.

- Kiyosaki* et. al.'s poor dad character would say "money is the root of all evil".

- But Kiyosaki et. al.'s rich dad character would say "lack of money is the root of all evil".

I don't think it's a black-and-white either/or truth scenario like either of these two statements. (And indeed that is the point Author Kiyosaki is making by contrasting the two statements side-by-side. In other words, I'm now I'm agreeing with Author Kiyosaki's point)

However, coming more from the former mindset, now I'm more and more seeing the truth in the latter mindset.

On some level, it's about respecting the power of money. I think no matter whether money causes evil or not, one needs to respect the power of money, the power people assign to it.

Where are the Logs for MicroSIP softphone?

By author Morgan Jassen

Q:
Where are the Logs for MicroSIP softphone? (i.e. where is the call log file / call history log)
In some initial attempts I couldn't find where the logs were stored. Also searching online I couldn't find the answer in some attempts. So I will post here with what I finally found :)

A:
On Windows (at least on my Windows 10 Installation of MicroSIP client), the call history for what seems like the last 999 calls seems to be stored in the microsip.ini file, i.e. here:
C:\Users\(your-user-name)\AppData\Roaming\MicroSIP\microsip.ini

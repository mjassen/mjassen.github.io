How so that Applying for a Job Does Not Feel Like Asking for Money?

by author Morgan Jassen

When a work income is one's sole source of income, it's easy to feel like applying for a job is asking for money — like asking for a gift of money.

This is because of the 1:1 ratio of the job-to-income–source ratio. Which means that my survival totally depends on my being employed, and with employment comes money, and without employment I have no money.

But it's extremely important that applying for a job doesn't feel like asking for a gift of money.

This is one good reason why it's important to start to understand investing and alternate (non-work–income) sources of income.

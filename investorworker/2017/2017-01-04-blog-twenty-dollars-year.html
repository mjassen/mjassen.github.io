How to Publish A Blog of My Thoughts to the World For Twenty-Two Dollars Per Year

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I want to publish a blog of my thoughts to the world, from my computer. I don't want to pay anything beyond what's ethical, nor pay anything beyond what I'm already paying for computer and internet service (even though I did end up paying $22 beyond it), nor pay anything beyond what it is worth. (how much is it really worth, might be another topic)

How have I done it?

Here's one way, which is how I did it, which as of right now is costing $22 per year. A high-level check-list:

- Existing internet connection.
- Computer running web server software and left running 24/7.
- Configure router port-forwarding.
- Pay $12/yr registration fee to get domain name registration for w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ and point it to the dynamic dns provider so that I don't have to point it to my numerical IP address.
- Pay $10/yr dynamic dns service ( for example <a href="https://www.dynu.com">https://www.dynu.com</a>, or other ), which allows me to point my domain name to it. As of this writing, the dynamic dns service routes the domain name to 24.63.224.58 -- that is to say it routes the domain name to whatever IP address my current (dynamic) IP address happens to be.
- Upload the website/files to the server. (Optionally, how I have done it, is to use static html pages instead of CMS/database. This is so the computer won't as easily be strained and break under moderate or under heavier traffic.)

In conclusion, this has been an overview description, including some lower-level details, of one way how to serve a blog of my thoughts to the world for $22/yr.

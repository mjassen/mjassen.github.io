Final report for Software Support and Development Work-project for weeks 25 & 26 (2017)

By author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I met in-person with a colleague and we talk about one case. We talk about making it into a feature request on <a href="http://ideas.woocommerce.com">ideas.woocommerce.com</a>. We looked at some github issues on <a href="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues">github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues</a>, and I got more of a feel for what the core devs are doing.

I research and progress this case: "How to adjust product thumbnails to fit to container?" <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-adjust-product-thumbnails-to-fit-to-container/">https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-adjust-product-thumbnails-to-fit-to-container/</a>

Note that most of the above was done during week 25. In Week 26 I (sadly) trailed off and had little activity.

In conclusion in weeks 25 & 26, I collaborated with a colleague, responded to at least one case, and learned some about the WooCommerce software and software in general.

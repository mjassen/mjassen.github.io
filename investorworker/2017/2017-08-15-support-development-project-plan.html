Work-project Plan for Weeks 33 & 34 (2017)

By author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

This is a plan for a two-week Software Support and Development learning/growth project for weeks 33 & 34 of 2017.

- Daily(weekdays), do the work! Read & write on a thread on the WordPress.org WooCommerce forum.*

- Make it social! Plan to, at least one time in the two-week period, collaborate with another person on this project. Either for example meet in-person with a colleague to work on this prject, or for example join in the bi-weekly woocommercecommunity.slack.com meeting online.

- On the final day, after two weeks, I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during the Work-project, and what I learned.

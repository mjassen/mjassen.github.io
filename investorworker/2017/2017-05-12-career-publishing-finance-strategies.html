Re-arranging Career and Publishing and Finance Strategies

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

One of my few most important projects -- my job search, for the past few months has been consuming, and is about to continue to consume my life for at least the near future.

As it should, because it is truly important, and it has become more and more urgent.

Why is it important and urgent? A big reason is because I've arranged my life so that my income is almost solely dependent on work income.

Why did I do that? I think it's what a lot of people do, maybe without thinking about it. I know I didn't think about it much, and I ended up like this.

It's truly humbling and awesome that my financial and work lives are so closely intertwined, and this is a time in my life when I'm learning from experience how to balance them and how to re-arrange them for the future.

In terms of immediate impact, this may mean that I'll be blogging less, tweeting less, and networking less *unless those activities are in regards to a job prospect.*

I don't know this is the best thing to do long-term. It might be. It might not be. I'm still learning that. Because I have believed, and still to some extent believe, that blogging and social media would/will help develop my career in a good, long-term way, I'm reluctant to reduce my activity in these areas.

However, since I am where I am, I know something isn't right and isn't working. Thus I'm scrapping a lot and re-arranging a lot, and for now its time for the blogging and social media to become minimized, sharply! And temporarily stay that way, either until I either realize that it isn't/wasn't needed after all, or until I find a way for it to work in harmony with my life and career goals!

In other words, what I'm doing now hasn't been working on some level. I have to step back from everything, and then go forward in a way that I think will work to solve my immediate problem. And that will probably be to lean even harder on a traditional job search process.

Also, I don't know if I will be renewing the w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ domain name in a few months. This also has to do with needing income and having been dependent on work income.

So I'll now go figure out work, figure out work income, figure out how to arrange my future income in a more stable way, and the next series of events may tell whether or not I'll be back to heavier blogging again a few months or years down the line!

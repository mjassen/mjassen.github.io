Work-project Plan for Weeks 39 & 40 (2017)

By author Morgan Jassen

This is a plan for a two-week Software Support learning/growth project for weeks 39 & 40 of 2017.

- Daily(weekdays), do the work! Read & write on a thread on the WordPress.org forum. (<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/">https://wordpress.org/support/</a>)

- Make it social! Collaborate with someone on this project.

- On the final day, after two weeks, I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during the Work-project.

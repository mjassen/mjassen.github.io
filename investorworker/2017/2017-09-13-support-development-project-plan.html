Work-project Plan for Weeks 37 & 38 (2017)

By author Morgan Jassen

This is a plan for a two-week Software Support and Development learning/growth project for weeks 37 & 38 of 2017.

- Daily(weekdays), do the work! Read & write on a thread on the WordPress.org forum.*

- Make it social! Plan to, at least one time in the two-week period, collaborate with another person on this project.

- On the final day, after two weeks, I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during the Work-project.

Professionalism is Calling People out on Bad Actions Even if Doing so is Mean

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I'm making a big life change from being nice to calling people out.

I'll now be calling people out whenever I feel their current action is not good.

Some history is that I've been a personality who values nice above most else.

However, after deliberate reflection, I've realized one effect of this has been crippling, chronic, anxiousness.

The solution is, instead of being nice 95% of the time, I'll now instead be calling others out right away, urging them to be good and to be professional.

In the past the worst thing I could imagine was to be mean to people, partly out of fear of wrongly accuse people of not being good or of being unprofessional.

I realize that statistically speaking, calling others out 100% percent of the time will mean sometimes I wrongly call them out. However now in mature hindsight, if this is unintentional, then it's unavoidable. I and other humans are flexible. If a professional good human makes a mistake, then we will realize it and we will fix it.

I'll also be expecting goodness and professionalism of myself. That is to say, I'll be calling myself out my own bad actions.

That's it. The life change is happening, this blog post is a reminder that it's happening.

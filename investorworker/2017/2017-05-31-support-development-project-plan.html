Work-project plan for weeks 21 & 22 (2017)

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

This is a plan for a two-week Software Support and Development learning/growth project for weeks 21 & 22 of 2017.

- Daily(weekdays), do the work! Read & write on a thread on the WordPress.org WooCommerce forum and the GitHub WooCommerce issue queue.*

- Arrange it so that weekly, at least one of the work sessions will be performed in-person in collaboration with another person. (The key here being that it must be a face-to-face meeting.)

- Attend the bi-weekly woocommercecommunity.slack.com meeting online, and participate where I can add value.

- On the final day, after two weeks, I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during the Work-project, and what I learned.

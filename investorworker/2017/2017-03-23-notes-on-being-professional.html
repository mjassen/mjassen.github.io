Notes on Being Professional

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

1. In a professional context, "being nice" is important, but it is often not the *most important* thing.

2. In a professional context, in order to discern what they are doing, it's ok to observe people (or a person) closely, or for a long time.

If I let "being nice" get in the way of acting professional, or if I avoid observing professionals carefully enough and thus fail to discern what their true actions are, then shame on me!

In order to be professional, I need to see what colleagues are _doing_ to a clear extent. I don't just need to hear what they are saying. I also need to very well discern what they are _doing_.

Now, to be good, or professional, I need to do these.

Moving on!

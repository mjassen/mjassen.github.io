Investing Can Be a Family Endeavor

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

One specific benefit of doing investing income-producing activites, compared with other income-producing activities (such as earning income by working), is that investing can more easily be a family activity.

"Rich Woman"* book points out that as investor, I can be woman or man, and that I can also bring my kids, and/or other family members, along.

For example, if I remember correctly, in the book was the example of the whole family going along to look at real estate properties.

My additional thought on this is: ", ...or to log in online and trade stocks, ...or to own a business and have my kid, or other relative, come along to meetings and walkthroughs..., ...and more!...".

Whereas, compare this with work/employee settings. In these settings it's often frowned upon to bring kids or other relatives to work -- unacceptable. Also, for excluding kids, professional conferences. I don't see, or hear of, many people bringing kids to professional conferences.**

Business ownership, patent ownership, real estate ownership, stock ownership -- these all can be shared with family. Employment status and employment experience and employee professional development is harder to share with family, especially in the culture of the United States.

In conclusion, a benefit of investment income as opposed to employment income is that doing investment income-producing activites can more easily be a family activity, when compared with other income-producing activities such as work income.

** About professional conferences, there are some exceptions -- to an extent I've seen at least one parent/child attendee at a WordCamp conference. And I'm sure there are other exceptions. But still not many kid attendees, and kid-friendly conferences, when considered against the number of overall attendees, and the number of professional conferences, respectively.

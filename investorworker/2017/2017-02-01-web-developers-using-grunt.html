Local Web Developers are Using Grunt

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

Lately, from following on social media, or networking with, two local (Boston area) web Devs, I've been learning that Web Developers are using Grunt. (and a bit about how they're using Grunt)

One source indicates they use Grunt in the environment of Drupal 8 (Twig/Nodejs) with the Basic theme. Another indicates they use Grunt when dealing with WordPress Dashicons.

I'm glad to be able to network with local web developers, or follow their publishings on social media, to find out actual examples of tools that other web developers are actually using.

I think it will make me a stronger developer.

Also, I believe that investigating what a fellow web dev is working on, and asking them to share a note about it with me, will allow the other dev to reflect on how their work (and workflow) developed (and is developing), and thus will help them become a stronger web developer too!

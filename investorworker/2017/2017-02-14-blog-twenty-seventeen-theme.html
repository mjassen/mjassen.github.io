On Having Read the Blog Post: "Behind the Scenes of Twenty Seventeen"

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I sometimes follow choycedesign.com, especially because their habit of blogging about Web Development -related topics.

This time, I read the post "Behind the Scenes of Twenty Seventeen" (<a href="https://choycedesign.com/2016/12/07/behind-the-scenes-of-twenty-seventeen/">https://choycedesign.com/2016/12/07/behind-the-scenes-of-twenty-seventeen/</a>)

Thanks to the author for having shared this blog post!

Some of my thoughts:
- I liked it that the post taught me a bit about how the core team was structured; the blog post says the core team was a designer, a developer, and a project-manager -type person. Their names are linked in the article.

- I liked it that the post taught me that the theme had somewhat of a long develpment history, even before being worked on as the WordPress Twenty Seventeen theme. It taught me that the in the process of developing a WordPress theme, the theme can get better as it goes through multiple drafts or iterations!

- I was grateful that the author linked to other resources in case I want to see others' perspectives on the same topic. That is, others' perspectives on the creation of the Twenty Seventeen theme. (the post linked to an article on wordpress.org/news, and to one on davidakennedy.com)

In conclusion, from reading the blog article I learned that there were three core develpers, that the theme went through many iterations over time, and that there exists further specific reading about its development.

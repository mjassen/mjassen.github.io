Thoughts on Having Read Blog Post of 8 Stretches for your Study Break

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I came across this blog post: "8 Stretches for your Study Break" <a href="http://www.mitrecsports.com/wellness/8-stretches-study-break/">http://www.mitrecsports.com/wellness/8-stretches-study-break/</a>

I came across it by having followed MIT Libraries (<a href="http://libraries.mit.edu/news/">http://libraries.mit.edu/news/</a>), which, clicking around and through linked pages, led to seeing this tweet: <a href="https://twitter.com/MITRecreation/status/809398084161728512">https://twitter.com/MITRecreation/status/8...512</a>, which in turn linked to the blog article.

I commented on the blog post, writing how I liked this blog post, including some specific things I liked about it, i.e. how it was nice how the stretches/exercises can be done in a small space, and how they are good for any office-worker professionals, and how I liked the descriptive gifs.

Since then, I see MIT Recreation posted back a comment on my comment. Thanks to MIT Recreation for having published this, and for having published and replied my comment!

From this, I learned some new variations on some great, healthy stretches.

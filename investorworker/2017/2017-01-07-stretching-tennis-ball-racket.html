Desk-Job Stretching by Hitting Tennis Ball with Racket

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I need something to relieve stress, that I can do from my desk, for two minute breaks througout the day.

I found this old tennis racket and ball. I started hitting it up in the air seeing how long I can keep it going.

After about a minute, I'm already breathing deeper and easier. I'm going to keep this in my arsenal of stretching techniques.

It also feels good for my eyes. Now I'm beginning to understand more why people play ping-pong breaks at work. ( or nerf-dart, or foosball, etc. )

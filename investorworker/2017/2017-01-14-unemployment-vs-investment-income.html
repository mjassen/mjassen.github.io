Unemployment income -- The Opposite of Investment Income?

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I've been learning about unemployment income. This comes after recently having read "Rich Dad, Poor Dad"* book which is about investment income.

Both of these types of income are relatively new areas of knowledge for me, and both coming at near the same time.

It strikes me that unemployment income could be considered the polar opposite of investment income.

Massachusetts state unemployment benefits are offered to certain qualified people who have recently lost work and who are actively looking for work.

Learning more about it, along with the unemployment income are certain quantifiable requirements that the unemployed person also be actively looking for a job, and be recording notes of how they are actively looking for a job. Also required is attending a seminar.

I don't recall that the Rich Dad book even mentioned unemployment income -- and why would it?! The book focuses on ideas and techniques of generating income while personally doing as little work as possible.

Whereas unemployment income comes only when attached to the act of actively seeking work and the employment income that comes with work.

My final thought to end up this blog post is that I think it's amazing that there are such different forms of financial income in our world. It's interesting to learn about and to compare and contrast.

How to Know When to ask for Help at Work by Quantifying it by a Numerical Value

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

LOVE it that this article quantifies, or gives a numerical value to, how one may know when to ask for help:

The Right Way to Ask for Help at Work ( <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/09/20/the-right-way-to-ask-for-help-at-work/#133056b22ee8">http://www.forbes.com/...-ask-for-help-at-work...8</a> )

As a person who sometimes has a hard time asking for help at work, I wanted to learn better how to ask for help. What I wanted was direct instructions of how I might know when to ask for help. And this article has helped me learn this, largely by the rule written within.

Quote from the article:

"...The trick here is knowing when it’s time to suck it up, swallow your pride, and admit you’re stuck. My general rule of thumb is basically the “Three Strikes” rule. If I can’t figure something out after I’ve exhausted at least three other solutions on my own, it’s time to admit I need a little inspiration. ..."

In conclusion, as a Software Developer I'll refer back to this when I want a refresher to remember how to know when to ask for help -- I'll remember that after I have made (and failed at) three legitimate tries to create a solution, then it is time to ask for help.


****** START BONUS TIP ******

How to know when to stop worrying about something by quantifying it by a numerical value.

Love this one too. Similar idea.

This is a tip to quantify when to pause and re-think the situation -- about when to stop worrying about something. After you (me too) worry about something for the seventeenth time, that's when to take a break from worrying about it. I thought I'd put in in here as a bonus as well, because it beautifully quantifies a measurement of how much worry is too much worry. I heard this quote in a video on minimalism where they interviewed the persona of Dan Harris. Here are links to two blog posts that refer to the same quote, followed by an excerpt from the first blog post:

"How to be 10% Happier" <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2014/10/dan-harris-10-percent-happier/">https://www.farnamstreetblog.com...-happier/</a>
"Dan Harris on the Utility of Worry" <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/utility/">http://www.theminimalists.com/utility/</a>

The quote, from the farnamstreetblog post above, and also from the short video excerpt embedded in the theminimalists post above:

"But when you find yourself running through your trip to the airport for the seventeenth time, perhaps ask yourself the following question: ‘Is this useful’?"

As a Software Developer I'll refer back to this when I want a refresher to remember how to know when to stop worrying about something.

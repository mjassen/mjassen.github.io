Plan for 2017-02-03 WordPress Plugin Developer Volunteer-work-project

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

This post describes a learning/growth project.

The goal is for me to work with plugin users towards solving their problems on the WordPress.org support forums (see my link to my profile here: <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mjjojo">https://profiles.wordpress.org/mjjojo</a>), and to, in a structured way via this volunteer work, to myself grow and learn about WordPress Plugin Development.

Here are the details. Starting 2017-02-03, for two weeks duration, for at least 30 minutes' time per each weekday, I’ll:

- Daily (weekdays), check in on the wordpress.slack.com #forums channel. (Say hi, be social. Don’t be shy. Thus I can learn from my peers, and them from me. )

- Daily, do the work! (Read & Write -— read & reply to a thread on the <a href="http://WordPress.org/support">http://WordPress.org/support</a> forums, more specifically, focus limited to support in the below-listed* plugin support forums.

Additionally, I'll do the following:

- On the final day, after two weeks, write and blog the “Final report”. This should be a list of bullet points, or a list of paragraphs, whenever possible including details (links and dates+times etc.) describing what happened during the Work-project, and what I learned.

- One week before the final day, I will either blog again, or update this post, with a note regarding whether or not I'll be extending the project for another two-week sprint.

This has been a description of my plan for a 2017-02-03 <del>-01-20</del> WordPress Plugin Developer Open Source Volunteer Work-project. I’ll see you on the forums on the chat! And look for my follow-up blog post “final report” on the last day.

* List of plugins I want to support. Basically, it is most plugins from these companies that I can understand well enough to support. These companies:
10up (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/10up#content-plugins">https://profiles.wordpress.org/10up...</a>)
Automattic (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/automattic/#content-plugins">https://profiles.wordpress.org/automattic...</a>)

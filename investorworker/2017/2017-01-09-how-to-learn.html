Refer to this Article for a Remider of How To Learn

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I refer back to this article when I want to remind myself how to learn:

"Learning to Learn" <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/03/learning-to-learn">https://hbr.org/2016/03/learning-to-learn</a>

The article says these four traits/habits are important to learning, and furthermore implies that anyone can improve themselves (get better) in these areas: "...aspiration, self-awareness, curiosity, and vulnerability..."

One trait of those who learn well in this article is curiosity or "...they constantly think of and ask good questions...".

Furthermore, this reminds me of what I heard in audiobook of "The Opposite of Spoiled"* (Ron Lieber et al.) -- he mentions a story of a parent who asks their child each evening (paraphrasing) '(child's name here), Did you ask a good question today?'

The parent was trying to develop and instill the child's sense of curisosity.

* "The Opposite of Spoiled - Raising Kids Who Are Grounded, Generous, and Smart About Money" (Book) : Lieber, Ron: New York, NY; Harper, an imprint of HarperCollinsPublishers, [2015]. ISBN: 9780062247018 (<a href="https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/4670531075_the_opposite_of_spoiled">https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/..._opposite_of_spoiled</a>)

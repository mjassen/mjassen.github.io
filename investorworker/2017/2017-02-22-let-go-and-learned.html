What I Learned by Having Been Let go from a Web Developer Role

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

Upon having been let go (terminated; fired) from a Web Developer role, I have done some considerable reflection, and I have learned a couple things about how I failed, and about what I can do better next time in order to have a better chance of succeeding.

Here they are:

- In the future, during the hiring process, I should ask any and all questions needed to discern how well I will fit in, whether it be culturally, or whether it be which technologies and tools are needed, or whether it be knowing what productivity milestones I will need to reach and by what dates I'll need to reach them.

- In the future, I'll make it especially be my responsibility to find out who all the stakeholders are related to my new role, and with each of these people, have in-depth conversations about what the job role entails. By learning exactly what the job is, I'll then be able to objectively decide with great accuracy, whether or not I'll be able to do the job; I'll be sure that I'll be able to perform to all stakeholders' expectations.

- In the future, after having been hired, and all the time really, I'll strive to actively learn (and use) emotional intelligence, and by doing so be professional, and thus learn how I'm performing, and thus learn how to act so that I can perform well.

In conclusion, these are some things I've learned, and these are some ways how I can do better next time.

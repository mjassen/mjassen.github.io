Inspired by Goal Focus of A WordPress Developer

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I read “My Goal to be More Focused and Productive” (Posted on January 2, 2017 by Geoffrey) ( <del>https://wpadventure.com/goal-focused-productive</del> )

Thanks to the persona of Geoffery the author for having shared this. It's inspiring to read what they are doing to focus their career and plan their career.

As a result, I commented as such on their blog post, and it became published. (So thanks as well to the blog admin for having let my comment through to become published!)

My comment basically said that I liked that the author's blog post contains a concrete plan made of specific steps, but balances that with the concept that, ultimately, this is a set of guidlines and that the important things are the underlying goals. Then I shared a link to a productivity blog post that I had written.

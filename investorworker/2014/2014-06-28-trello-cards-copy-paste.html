In Trello How to Create Multiple Cards with Copy and Paste

I love Trello for to-do lists. Shout out to Trello!
<a href="https://trello.com">https://trello.com</a>

Here’s a Trello question I ran into, and the answer.

How do I force trello to prompt me every time to choose, so that I
will always have the choice to have my list either be made into one
card or multiple cards? I mean the prompt: "If you want, we can
create a card for every new line. That would be x cards. You can also
create one card with a long title."

Into a trello card when I copy and paste text containing line
breaks (new lines), it seems like it sometimes presents me with a
prompt whether I want to create multiple cards vs. one card. Yet it
seems like sometimes it doesn’t prompt me with this choice.

For example a week or two ago I remember I pasted a text with some
line breaks into a card and it prompted me one or multiple cards.
That time I just wanted one, so I chose one.

But going forward, at least once per day, I am going to need to
paste a list of about a dozen items into Trello and need them to
become multiple cards.

So my question is, how can I force the prompt to come up every
time?

Googling for "trello how to create multiple cards with copy
and paste", comes up with some articles from blog.trello.com and
help.trello.com such as:

<a href="http://blog.trello.com/using-trello-like-a-pro-part-2/">http://blog.trello.com/using-trello-like-a-pro-part-2/</a>

and

<a href="http://help.trello.com/customer/portal/articles/1376934-importing-data-into-trello">http://help.trello.com/customer/portal/articles/1376934-importing-data-into-trello</a>

These said I could copy and paste lists. So following the advice I
tried the following things:

-I made a list in Textwrangler for Mac, separated by line breaks,
and then copied and pasted it into trello. Without prompting me to
choose, it went in as a single card.

-In MS Word for Mac, I made my list into a bullet-point list, then
copied and pasted the list into trello. Without prompting me to
choose, it went in as a single card.

-In MS Excel for Mac, I made my list into a column of cells, then
ctrl+clicked on the column header and chose "copy", then
pasted into trello. Without prompting me to choose, it went in as a
single card.

So what’s the trick? How do I force trello to prompt me every time
to choose, so that I will always have the choice to have my list
either be made into one card or multiple cards?

The answer:

Using it some more, I got it to prompt every time whether I want
one or multiple cards.

I found that after clicking "Add a card…" and then
pasting the multi-line text, if I *then proceed to click the green
"Add" button*, it’ll then prompt me whether I want one card
or multiple cards.

That solves this issue for me. Thanks for reading!

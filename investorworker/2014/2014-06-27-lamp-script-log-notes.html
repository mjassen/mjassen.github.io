A Script to Create a Log – a Log that is a Text Field that Stores
Notes

I created log.php on github — a (LAMP) PHP script to create a
log. The log is a text field for notes. The notes could represent
things. For example I may use it to hold song lyrics. Or journal
entries, or blog posts, or account ledger entries, or calendar
entries or notes-of-the-day’s-accomplishments. The script displays an
html text field form with one textarea in which by default appears
the current date and time down to the current minute. Then below the
textarea are printed the previous entries in descending alphabetical
order.(and so if the date and time is input each time it will cause
the entries to appear with most recent entries at the top.)

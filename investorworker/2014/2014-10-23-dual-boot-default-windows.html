Windows and Ubuntu Dual Boot – How to by Default Boot to Windows

I want to make Windows the default operating system that my PC boots into. (In other words I want Windows to appear first in the grub menu boot list.)

I search/google and find this article: I search/google and find this article: <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/52963/how-do-i-set-windows-to-boot-as-the-default-in-the-boot-loader/52990#52990">How do I set Windows to boot as the default in the boot loader?</a>

In short, what did I find that worked for me?

In a terminal type:

fgrep menuentry /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Then find the entry for windows, for example. “Windows 8 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)”. Then run:

gksu gedit /etc/default/grub

Then Change the entry “GRUB_DEFAULT=0″ to:

GRUB_DEFAULT=”Windows 8 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)”

Save, then type:

sudo update-grub

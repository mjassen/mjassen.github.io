In the Desk.com Case List Teammates’ Cases-being-worked are Highlighted Gray

In Desk.com, in the case list when my teammate is working on a case, the case is highlighted in a darker grey than the other cases. I confirmed this by hovering my mouse over any of the dark gray cases in the list and I see the “Morgan Doe is currently working on this case.” message in the popover-details-window.

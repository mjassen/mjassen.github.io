Why Do WordPress? Spoiler: Because it is School.

Recently I talked with a colleague. One topic from our
conversation made me think more afterwards. They expressed distaste
for spending effort and time on an open source project unless getting
paid/compensated for it.

Immediately another question came to my mind. Why do WordPress? I
didn’t know the answer right away. But then after thinking more
later, the reason is it is school. I do wordpress to stay in school.
I can go on the forums, IRC, blogs, github, and participate in this
educational project with my peers.

A Helper Plugin that Puts CrazyStat Include Tag in the WordPress
Footer

I previously wrote a
<del>./2014-05-08-installed-crazystat-wordpress-39.html</del>.

This has worked. Now I’ve got some stats on who’s visiting my
WordPress-powered website.

I realized that soon I might want to change my WordPress theme. My
include script for CrazyStat is hard-coded in my site’s child theme.
So If I change to a new theme I’ll need to modify the new theme to
make a child theme and put the include script in its footer.

Thus I devised <a href="https://github.com/mjassen/mzz-include-crazystat">this mzz-include-crazystat
helper plugin</a> that puts the include script in the footer for me.
The plugin’s README file has more details.

Trying out a Form of School that Consists of Blogging about weekly Goals Progress

This post is the manifestation of trying out a form of "School" that consists of weekly blogging about my specific progress towards my specific goals.

In other words, the idea is to, weekly, blog about what I did and learned in these areas:
PROSPERING
THRIVING
LEARNING
SHARING


Without further ado, here's the first one. Here's what it looked like for last week. Here's what I did this week in terms of my goals, and my tasks towards those goals:

PROSPERING
- The week of 6/5-6/11, to prosper by investing, I put $3 in my long-term investing jar, which once it reaches $500 I'll use to buy SBUX shares direct.

THRIVING
- The week of 6/5-6/11, to thrive by exercising, I went to the gym twice to do calisthenics for 15 minutes each. I also stretched for 15 minutes on two mornings.

LEARNING
- The week of 6/5-6/11, to Learn by networking, I read some on <a href="http://www.openparenthesis.org/">http://www.openparenthesis.org/</a> blog and retweeted a link to it on twitter. Also, I read two articles that I found through <a href="http://ryandebeasi.com/">http://ryandebeasi.com/</a>  and retweeted links to one of them on twitter.

SHARING
- The week of 6/5-6/11, to share by working, I worked with my colleague to investigate a problem and perform a manual workaround. I then switched to another problem, until my other colleague alerted me that another instance of this other symptom had occurred.

<h2>
For a Software Developer How to Network
</h2>
<P>
For a Software Developer it’s important to network
professionally.
</P>
<P>
Have a list of some people’s names with whom you want to
network. At a pace which you feel comfortable (it could be three per
day or it could be one per month; whatever is your style!) call the
first person on the list, and first off say “just checking in” or
“I’m calling to say hi and see how you’re doing. What’s going
on with you?”
</P>
<P>
And then listen to what they say.
</P>
<P>
If no answer or I don’t have their number , then I either text
or email a follow-up note.
</P>
<P>
The point is to stay in touch, be friendly, and say hi. This can
facilitate you both helping each other – now or in the future.
</P>
<P>
This is how a sw dev can network professionally.
</P>
<P>
Ideally it can end in either of you landing a job now or in the
future – through s friend of a friend. However that is a side
effect of what’s going on here which is friendship, trust-building
and prof networking.
</P>
<P>
Finally, move that person’s name from first to last place on
the list. Repeat with the next name on the list at your own
comfortable pace (But, make sure that you have the self-discipline to
follow through and do it at regular intervals at this pre-determined
pace).
</P>
<P>
Finally-finally, Note that some people won’t want to network.
Either cycle their name down on the list to try when it comes around
again, or, take their name off the list. We only want to network with
those who are open to networking with us! Our goal is that as a
whole, we’re not bugging anybody, we’re keeping it relaxed, and
we’re networking professionally.
</P>

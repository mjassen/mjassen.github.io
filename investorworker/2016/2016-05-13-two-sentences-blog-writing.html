Adapting Two.sentenc.es to Blog Writing

I heard of two.sentenc.es from the persona of Carolyn Kopprasch ( https://twitter.com/carokopp ) of supportops.co podcast fame.

But I can’t bring myself to use it for email because I don’t truly believe that would be realistic — *However* I love the idea and will play with using the same concept *for writing blog posts*!

Q: Why is this blog post three sentences or less?

A: http://two.sentenc.es/

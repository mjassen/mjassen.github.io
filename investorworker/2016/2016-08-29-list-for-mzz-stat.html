<P>Here’s the link to the current revision at the time of this blog
post writing:

</P>
<P>Since then, I’ve done this::
</P>
<P>– Added a changelog file and started writing the changes there
as I do them.
</P>
<P>– Removed hard-coded PHP MySQL database calls, replaced them
instead with native WordPress database calls.
</P>
<P>– Added plugin install logic and plugin removal logic, including
code to install and remove the database table and data.
</P>
<P>Here’s my updated to-do list. It has changed to become more
focused. Some items taken out and new added. (Re-prioritized
next-steps for the development of the plugin)
</P>
<P>1. Remove front-end shortcode feature; instead move it to a
dashboard area where an admin can view the stat(s). The reason is
that the user of this plugin is envisioned to be the WordPress site
admin and not a site visitor.
</P>
<P>2. More clearly define the purpose of the plugin and how to use
it. Write these clearly into the readme of the plugin. start to get
the plugin ready for submission to the WordPress plugin repository.
(Use this codex article (and the pages it links to) as a starting
point guide: “Plugin Submission and Promotion” (
<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_Submission_and_Promotion">https://codex.wordpress.org..._and_Promotion</a> )
</P>
<P>3. Submit the plugin to the WordPress.org plugins repository.
</P>
<P>4. In addition to the total site visitors that now can be
displayed, while it’s moved to the admin area, let’s also display
a per-month and per-day visit count breakdown.
</P>
<P>5. In the proposed admin stats area, let’s display a list of
which URIs the visitor visited. (this is already captured, now let’s
display it to the admin)
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>That’s what I’ve done and what I will do, to further develop
the mzz-stat plugin.

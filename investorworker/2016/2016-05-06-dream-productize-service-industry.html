A Dream to Productize Service Industry Starting with Software Support and Development Engineer Service

I was distilling a previous blog post some more. (“As a Software Support and Development Engineer What I Do and What I Produce”, <a href="https://i̶n̶v̶e̶s̶t̶o̶r̶w̶o̶r̶k̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2015.php?2015-10-03#2015-10-03">https://i̶n̶v̶e̶s̶t̶o̶r̶w̶o̶r̶k̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/2015.php?2015-10-03#2015-10-03</a> ) I finally got to define what I produce in terms of goods and services. In doing so I ended up thinking of the value, to a Software Support and Development Engineer, of being able to quantify the results of one’s work.

A dream is that any service industry professional should be able to do the same. For example a delivery driver should be able to quantify their performance in terms of “Deliveries”. And they can from there sell their deliveries as a product, positing that their Deliveries are excellent quality, and that their deliveries are worth $xx. apiece, and to ask anyone and they’ll say that their deliveries are high quality and are worth $xx. apiece. But this post focuses on the same but for a Software Support and Development Engineer.

A dream is that a Software Support and Development Engineer should be able to quantify in terms of number of messages produced. And posit that their messages are worth $xx apiece. So as a Software Support and Development Engineer I can say that my messages are excellent quality, and so they are worth this price of $xx apiece. This productizing — this treating the results of my work as goods — this gives us a bargaining tool to really express the value that we add to our company. The benefit is that it allows a Software Support and Development Engineer to know, talk about, and feel, how much value they add, and what our effort is worth.

I feel like this should be called a dream, because this is not the way things are, and, there’s not a plan for this to become the way things are.

Moving on. what’s the point?

The point is, the dream is for all service pros to be able to quantify their perfomance by amount of goods produced and not by number of hours passed on the clock while they worked.

As A Software Development and Support Engineer Balancing Consistency with Flexibility

As a Software Support and Development Engineer I must lose consistency and gain flexibility, until I reach a balance.

‘Consistency is the hobgoblin of a small mind’ (quoted from memory – from on the OurSQL Podcast, one of the very early episodes while there was just the founding host Sheeri and there was a “quote of the day’.)

I’ve heard people describe this in other people as, “(He) has demons”.

How can I tone down the consistency just a bit, not value consistency for consistency’s sake, and become more flexible?

As the Trailer Park Boys might say, how can I ‘self smart’ myself — ‘from nature’?

If I can tend away from extreme consistency, and become more flexible in the way I think for high-level aspects of my suite of professional behavior, it will benefit my career greatly.

I heard it quoted elsewhere that ‘the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome’, which is along these same lines.

There can be strength in flexibility. Consistency can be a strength but is perhaps at direct odds with flexibility which is also strength.

Therefore they must be balanced.

I need to lose consistency and gain flexibility.

In conclusion, as a Software Support and Development Engineer I must lose consistency and gain flexibility, until I reach a balance.

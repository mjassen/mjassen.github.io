Olsen Light WordPress Theme How to Create a Child Theme

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

Recently after having replied to a support topic for the Olsen Light Theme for WordPress ( <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/olsen-light/">https://wordpress.org/themes/olsen-light/</a> ), I've been subscribing to the support issue feed for the Olsen Light Theme. ( <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/theme/olsen-light/feed">https://wordpress.org/support/th.../feed</a> )

Someone asked in a forum thread how to modify CSS for the theme. I wanted to reply that I think they should create a child theme first. However I realized creating a child theme is not always that straightforward.

So I decided to figure out how to create a child theme for Olsen Light.

The WordPress Child Themes codex page helped me -- indeed was my guide to build the child theme. ( <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes</a> )

A caveat that I ran into was that making the functions.php file, at first I thought I had been supposed to make a line as thus:
   $parent_style = 'olsen-light-style';

As it turned out, I just needed to leave it alone and paste it just as in the tutorial, as this:
   $parent_style = 'parent-style';


Here's a link to the finished child theme that I authored, including readme instructions:

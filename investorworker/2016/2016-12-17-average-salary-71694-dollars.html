What is One Average of a Web Developer Salary in 2016? -- Spoiler alert: it is $71,694.50

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

What is an objective, average, market standard, ("commodity") salary, for a person, who is a Web Developer in the United States and/or in Massachusetts in 2016?

It's $71,694.50, and here below is how I calculated it.

I added four sources of average Web Developer salary in United States and/or Massachusetts that were close to 2016, and divided by four. (see sources linked below) That was: ($75,540 + $66,238 + $87,000 + $58,000) / 4 = $71,694.50

What about for a person? Well a Web Developer is a person, so that counts. But just to compare some other people to confirm that. Compare it to Customer Support people at $68,540, and Teachers at $74,737. (again, see sources linked below) Web Developer average salary sits in-between the two, so that checks out by answering "yep, that's near to what other professional people are making nearby too."

These results are not 100% conclusive. Also, I truly do see salary as only one part of an overall compensation package. Not only that, I think one should consider non-compensation-related factors when looking for a job, for example, am I a culture fit for the company, and is this a role where I will be effective, a role where I will be adding to the bottom line, and will my work be in alignment with the company's goals?

Still, salary is one important piece of a job. And it's important to get it right, pay attention to it, and periodically review it.

In conclusion, a salary is one important piece of an overall compensation package for a Web Developer, and as such should be meditated upon, and an objective average market standard salary for a person who is a Web Developer in the United States and/or in Massachusetts in 2016 would be $71,694.50.


[ 2017-03-02 Update:

So if that's the average salary per year, then what would be the corresponding average hourly wage? Let's calculate it as 40 hrs./wk, with 52 weeks per year.

( ($71,694.50 / 52 weeks) / 40 hrs/wk. ) = $34.47. So based on this, a matching hourly rate would be $34.47/hr. ]

<h2>How TJD (Target Job Deconstruction) Helped me with My Current Job</h2>
<P>I re-did my Software Development and Support Engineer resume by
doing a TJD (Target Job Deconstruction), and an unexpected side
effect was that it helped me with my current job.</P>
<P>In order to update my resume, per the advice of &quot;Knock 'em
Dead&quot; job seeking (career development) book ( by Martin Yate), I
performed a TJD.</P>
<P>I expected it to help me to craft an excellent resume and that's
all.</P>
<P>But in addition to that, it also made me become more engaged in my
current job.</P>
<P>How did it do this? In doing the TJD one night, while looking
through job requirements for 6 job descriptions similar to my target
job, I found that two of the requirements I was weak on.</P>
<P>And furthermore, for one of those two, although I hadn't ever had
direct experience, I recognized that my colleague's project from that
very morning was fulfilling that requirement!</P>
<P>Of course, the next day, I made a point to ask my colleague how
that project was going, what details they could share, and how I
could help.</P>
<P>Thus because I deconstructed my desired role off-hours, I knew
clearly what I needed to work on &amp; learn about next!</P>
<P>This is a *specific* example of how reading &quot;Knock 'em Dead&quot;
book, generally is good for professional development *regardless of
whether a Software Development and Support Engineer is currently
seeking a job or not*. This is how doing a TJD (Target Job
Deconstruction) helped me with my current job.</P>

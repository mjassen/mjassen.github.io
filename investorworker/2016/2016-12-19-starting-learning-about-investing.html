Starting Learning About Investing

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I'm learning about investing. I want to learn more about investing in stocks as well as learn more about investing in real estate. I want everyone else to, too!

Per a friend's suggestion about investing in bonds, I read the section about bonds in The Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Money and Investing ( Morris & Morris; Lightbulb Press; 1999) ( <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Street-Journal-Guide-Understanding-Investing/dp/0684869020">https://www.amazon.com/Street-...020</a> )

Borrowed from my local public library(via a hold via their inter-library loan system), I listened to audio book of "Rich Dad, Poor Dad"* book by the persona of Robert Kiyosaki.

The Rich Dad Poor Dad book really struck me because it seems like the author's persona is on *my* side, he doesn't sugar-coat things, and if what he says is true, he practices what he recommends and it really works. (His persona is a real estate investor who has earned millions.)

I want everyone else to read this book, too! Because I feel that the more people read it, the more people will understand financial wealth, and will grow wealthy, and furthermore that if everyone reads it, then everyone will start to understand financial wealth, and then everyone will grow wealthy.

While Kiyosaki's persona does simplify concepts to make them understandable, he doesn't make them sound easier than they are. In fact in the book he stresses the importance of self-discipline and the importance of constantly exercising one's brain.

Reading more on blogs such as <a href="http://www.richdad.com/resources/rich-dad-financial-education-blog">http://www.richdad.com/...-blog</a> as well as on blog posts such as "The struggle to raise money" by the persona of Seth Godin (<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/08/struggle-raise-money.html">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/...-money.html</a>), I'm learning that as financial assets go, there are what people call different categories of assets:

Categories of assets:
- paper (stocks, bonds)
- real estate
- IP (Intellectual Property) (trademarks, patents)
- IOUs ((Loan) notes)
- commodities
- ...and more?....

In conclusion, I'm starting learning about investing, and I'm learning about investing, and I want everyone to as well. I truly believe that this will lead to us all becoming richer, and that this means that we will all become better-off.

Thoughts on Having Read Rich Woman Book

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I recommend "Rich Woman"*, which I read, which is a book by the persona of Kim Kiyosaki because, through stories, the book humbly coaches the reader to empower themself to become wealthy and to become strong.

Here in this blog post is a summary of the book, and mixed in are some of my thoughts.

At 70 pages in, I knew it was as good as the "Rich Dad"** book.

From the unique point of view of the persona of Kim Kiyosaki, the author tells the story of herself, her friends, people, women, rich dad company, and more. Through the telling of these stories, the book relates a valuable message.

I liked that the book had a story feel to it. It's got stories of how she met up with her friends more than a decade later, and they discuss money, investing, financial independence, and more.

It's inspiring. The main characters, the ladies in the main story line, have trust from having known each other years ago. Additionally, now they have life experience with things like: working for money, owning a business, saving money, raising a family, having money troubles, and investing. Despite this experience, many of the characters in the story say that they don't understand, and/or value, the concept of financial independence. That is, until their old friend (Kim's character) imparts it to them.

The book's story (stories) resonate(s) with me since I've also had some familiar life experiences, and I also find myself being introduced to, or for the first time starting to understand, the concept of financial independence.

Furthermore, for those like me who have listened to the audio book of Rich Dad (or read it), Rich Woman book gives a complementary, value-added look on it. Indeed, the Rich Woman book itself, within its text, refers to the Rich Dad book, and builds upon it.

Furthermore again, the Rich Woman book combines the idea of humility with the idea of wealth, and gives the reader the feeling that the world is abundant with wealth and money enough for every person. The book explains what mindset to use, in order to tune into the universal truths surrounding these ideas. It's not just a book about money and becoming wealthy, but a book about becoming strong and being strong.

In conclusion, I recommend Rich Woman book by author Kim Kiyosaki because, through stories, the book humbly coaches the reader to empower themself to become wealthy and to become strong.

Thoughts on Intercom's "Wistia’s Jeff Vincent on solving customer problems" Interview Transcript

I read the transcript of this podcast interview: "Wistia’s Jeff Vincent on solving customer problems" (<a href="https://blog.intercom.com/wistias-jeff-vincent-on-solving-customer-problems">https://blog.intercom.com/wistias...-customer-problems</a>)

Some really good stuff in there about software company development and growth.

In the transcript, the Persona of Jeff Vincent tells about how Wistia's videos "work hard".

In other words, Wistia champions hard-working videos.

I like this. It reminds me of the phrase "Work smarter, not harder." People can work smarter rather than harder, but we can let videos keep working hard!

In the transcript, Jeff's persona tells about putting pressure on the software product to perform so that the customer doesn't have to lean on the software customer support team.

In the transcript, Jeff's persona tells about how he grew from a support person to support manager to product person/manager, and also tells about how at the same time the company grew in size to 10x the number of employees!

In the transcript, Jeff's persona tells about having been mentored by his manager who he indicated had a habit of saying something like 'There is a better way to do this', about problems they face.

The above are some things about software company development and growth, that still remain in my mind after having read through the transcript.

In other words,  in Intercom's "Wistia’s Jeff Vincent on solving customer problems" interview transcript, linked and referenced <del>in the</del> above <del>article</del>, there is some really good stuff in there about software company development and growth, both as seen through the lens of a software support person perspective and as seen through the lens of a software product management perspective.

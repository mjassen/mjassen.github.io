How to (Not) Become CEO

By w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ author <a href="http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/about.php?Morgan_Jassen#Morgan_Jassen">Morgan Jassen</a>

I just remembered vividly this view that I had as a kid that the way one becomes president, CEO, leader, boss, etc., is that one gets promoted from within by their boss, in a "from the bottom up" manner, until one day one can become CEO or president etc.

In my mind, that meant that one day there was a good chance that, I would be promoted to become CEO (like by the CEO's boss or by the board of directors.)

Today I realized that's not how it is. To be a leader one drives forward with a passion for collaborative ownership, and may or may not get to be CEO/president.

Funny though how in my 30s until this childhood paradigm of corporate hierarchy and promotion from within, got a major update in my mind. Needed to realize to update this sooner. A lot sooner. *weeps briefly for self, then gets over it and becomes a stronger professional*

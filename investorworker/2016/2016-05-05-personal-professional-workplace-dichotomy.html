Proposing a Strategy to Overcome Personal/Professional Workplace Conversation Dichotomy

Here I propose a strategy designed to help me as a Software Development and Support Engineer learn to more quickly switch between personal and work personas, and to overcome my tendency to prefer personal conversations.

When I tend to prefer personal conversations and avoid professional conversations in the workplace, my colleagues realize it and start to disengage with me as a professional. Which of course is murder to my (to anyone’s) career.

I need a plan! And I’ve thought of one.

To train myself to be more professional, I’ll enact a 30-day period where, at work, I ignore chitchat as if the other person didn’t say anything, and I instead reply with a work- related topic.

Then depending on how it has gone, after the 30 days I can try to again start participating in chitchat.

This strategy is designed to help me as a Software Development and Support Engineer to more easily switch into work mode, and to train myself away from preferring personal conversations.

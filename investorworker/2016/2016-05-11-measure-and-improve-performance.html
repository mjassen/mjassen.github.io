As a Software Support and Development Engineer How to Measure and Improve my Performance

Here are some distillations of how to measure and improve my software-development-and-support engineer performance.

In my previous post entitled: “As a Software Support and Development Engineer What I Do and What I Produce” ( http://wieldlinux.com/2015-10-03-what-I-do-produce.php ), I defined this:

“…

My primary service:

– Transport messages across distance with another person.

My primary goods-production:

– Produce messages, instructions and documents.

…”

Now that I have defined what I do and what I produce, I can do neat things with that knowledge, such as start to define how to measure my performance as a professional Software Support and Development Engineer, and how to improve my performance as well.

Here’s what I mean– how can I measure and improve my performance in terms of my service?

* The frequency and timeliness of messages does matter. My performance can be measured/improved by the frequency and timeliness of my message-sending.

* To improve my performance I must increase the frequency and maintain the timeliness of my message sending.

* The quality (accuracy and beauty) of the messages, instructions and documents should be consistently excellent, and the quantity (the number) of the messages matters. My performance can be measured on the quantity of high-quality messages that I send.

* To improve my performance I must increase the quantity of the high-quality messages that I send.

The above are some distillations of how to measure and improve my software-development-and-support engineer performance.

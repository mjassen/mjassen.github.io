<h2>
Support is Being There
</h2>
<P>
Supportops.co podcast episode #96 – “Make Meetings Count”
with guest Justin Seymour. (
<a href="http://supportops.co/96-make-meetings-count/">http://supportops.co/96-make-meetings-count/</a> ) Near the beginning of
the episode, Justin says something like: [as HelpScout customer
support, it’s our job to ] ‘be present for the customers’.
</P>
<P>
I liked hearing this because it seems accurate.
</P>
<P>
I’ve been thinking how it’s not accurate to describe Software
Customer Support role as “helping the customers”, nor is it
accurate to describe it as ‘problem solving’. ( see <STRIKE>What
Support is for a Software Support and Development Engineer
http://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶l̶i̶n̶u̶x̶.̶c̶o̶m̶/?p=1333</STRIKE> )
</P>
<P>
Instead, I like this description of ‘being present for the
customers’. Also I like “triaging customer issues” or
“troubleshooting customer issues”.
</P>
<P>
What does this mean for me as a software support person? “being
present for the customer”. describes “being”, not *doing*. So
in other words as a support person the accurate description of my job
is to just be there and have conversations with customers, direct
them how to use our software. Tell the customer how they can well use
our software.
</P>
<P>
Indeed it is as some have previously discussed — on the
supportdriven.com supportdriven.slack.com chat — software customer
support is like being a Hotel Concierge / Front-desk Role.

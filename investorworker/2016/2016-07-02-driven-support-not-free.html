Driven Support Not Free

How to get a “driven” Support job? (i.e. a Software Customer Support job in the attitude of the supportdriven.com community in 2015-2016 ) Maybe look for a company where the customers are valued and the role of support is empowered and valued.

Conversely, Be scrutinizing if these are anywhere in the sales or marketing messages:

Support is free

or

it comes with support

or

unlimited support

Which might indicate a company-wide attitude.

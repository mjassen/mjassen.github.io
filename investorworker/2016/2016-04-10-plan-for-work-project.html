Plan for 2016-04-10 to 2016-05-10 Open Source Volunteer Software Development and Support Engineer “Mentorship” ( Job-shadow / Informational-interview / Work-project )

This post outlines the plan for a learning/growth project for me. The goal is for me to work with users towards solving their problems on the WordPress.org support forums, and to, in a structured way via this volunteer work, to myself grow and learn about Software Development and Support. Today is day 0 of the plan. Here are the details:

Starting 2016-04-10 to 2016-05-10 (days 1-30), with “office hours” of 5:30am – 6:00am (New York time), I’ll:

On days 1-30, daily, during my “office hours”, check in on the wordpress.slack.com #forums channel. (Say hi, write what’s happening with me, read/ask what’s happening with other members of the support team, be social. Don’t be shy to “interview” (write to the channel to ask even one short sentence is fine) others on the channel what they are doing in terms of open source WordPress Software Support and Development. If I have a question, don’t be shy to write out onto the chat to ask the channel/team the question. Then read and acknowledge any replies. Thus my peers can be my “mentors”. )

On days 1-30, daily, during my “office hours, “Do the work!”(Read & Write — read & reply threads on the http://WordPress.org/support forums. Don’t be afraid if on a certain day, I read 10 (or 30!) threads and thus just “shadow” whats happening on forum threads. That’s learning too and is participating. Replying is good too, when it adds value.) Take a private note what happened (for my report later)

On day 31, that’s 2016-05-11, compiled from my private notes on days 1-30, write and blog the “Final report”. This should be a list of bullet points, or a list of paragraphs, whenever possible including details (links and dates+times etc.) describing what happened during days 0-30.

This has been a description of my plan for a 2016-04-10 to 2016-05-10 Open Source Volunteer Software Development and Support Engineer “Mentorship” ( Job-shadow / Informational-interview / Work-project ). I’ll see you on the forums on the chat! And look for my follow-up blog post “final report” on day 31 ( May 11, 2016).

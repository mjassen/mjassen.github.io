Regarding the Idea that Software Running on a Computer is a Person and does the work of a Person

1.
A computer software salesperson sell a software solution, saying that the software solution ‘does x y and z…’ and the software solution “takes care of x for you…”. This is common for a software salesperson to say.

2.
When troubleshooting a software solution issue, as a software support engineer I look for the answer to the question: “When and where, Who did What?” ( “____ and ____, ___ did ____?”) and in this question, By “Who” I mean (What person or What software user login of a software running on a computer).

In these two ways appears the idea that software-running-on-a-computer is a person and does the work of a person.

Final report for Project for weeks 43 & 44 (2019) - Learn About Databases (IV)

By author Morgan Jassen


In this two week sprint I did:

- Learned about database normalization.

- My group work team had a meltdown on time availability near deadline. We got some extra help and carried through extra hours to complete the work.

In this two week sprint I learned:

- I learned this sprint that I was not only tired but also burnt out as a worker (student).

- I learned Database normalization is quite hard because it consists of abstract definitions, and even after reviewing multiple examples, still I may not know it well enough to teach it.

In conclusion, in weeks 43 & 44 (2019), I learned about database normalization, project work, and worker burnout.

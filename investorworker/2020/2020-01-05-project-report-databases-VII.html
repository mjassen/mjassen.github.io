Final report for Project for weeks 49 & 50 (2019) - Learn About Databases (VII)

By author Morgan Jassen

In this two week sprint I did:

- Partner work at library, PHP/HTML/SQL scripts.

- Very late realized that different scripts were needed. Thus scrambling to re-adjust at last minute.

In this two week sprint I learned:

- When the high level goals or business rules of a project change mid-way, then the whole project (including the "physical" database and the application layer) must then immediately be changed to fit as well. If not immediately, then one will have to scramble/hustle before deadline.

- Learned the difference between what is a SQL query (i.e. basically a SELECT statement that returns rows) vs. a SQL statement (i.e. any SQL command).

In conclusion, in weeks 49 & 50 (2019), I learned about databases.

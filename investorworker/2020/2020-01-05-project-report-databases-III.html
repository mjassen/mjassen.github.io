Final report for Project for weeks 41 & 42 (2019) - Learn About Databases (III)

By author Morgan Jassen

In this two week sprint I did:

- Learned about, and practiced SQL joins.

In this two week sprint I learned:

- Still (as in the previous sprint(s)) I find I need to hustle to fit late night project-work hours into my schedule, and that hasn't gotten easier, but, is still sustainable thus far. However did sign off early some nights in order to maintain.

- I learned how to use a new tool to manage databases -- MySQL Workbench. For example it has line numbering, command completion, a query "Result Grid" display to show query results, and the ability to keep multiple query tabs open.

In conclusion, in weeks 41 & 42 (2019), I learned about databases.

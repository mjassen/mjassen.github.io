<h2>Review Paper.io</h2>
The name of this game is <a href="https://paper-io.com/">paper.io</a>.
If you know how to play, great. If not, I’ll teach you.
You are born like this:

A circle that has to grow.
After a while, if you add onto your circle, you should look like this:

The goal is to get big enough so that you are the leader/king.
You can also kill people by running into their lines.
People can also steal your land, like THE BROWN PLAYER is doing in the picture above.
I like this game because it is fun to play, and the rules are simple. If you did not understand my directions, just go to <a href="https://paper-io.com/">paper-io.com</a>, and try it out.
Have fun playing!

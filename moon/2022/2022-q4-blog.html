<h3 id="2022-12-20_0959-dont-smile-miranda-priestly"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-12-20_0959-dont-smile-miranda-priestly">Inspired to Not Smile by the Character of Miranda Priestly</a></h3>

Watching "The Devil Wears Prada" (movie)

And the Miranda priestly character inspires me.
And so now I’m gonna give it a try the thing where I don’t smile. Ever. Maybe for a month or maybe for a year.
This is similar to the idea of bullshitting and recognizing bullshit that I blogged about in past.

"35-Year-old Developer Learns To Bullshit" <a href="https://lemonmama.com/investorworker/2016/2016-06-28-35-learns-to-bullshit.html">https://lemonmama.com/investorworker/2016/2016-06-28-35-learns-to-bullshit.html</a>

Because you know what, there is the power in the smile, but there’s just as much power in not smiling.
 And so why not use the power of the smile both ways are either way.
and you know what? I feel I don’t owe it to anyone to smile at any given time.
And I feel like I don’t need to explain myself why I’m not smiling or why I’m smiling. And I feel like I don’t need to have an opinion on everything and relate my opinion to my smile.
and you know what I think a smile is gonna come out every now and then even though I’m not smiling most of the time consciously. Because when it does come out it’ll be a genuine smile and that’ll be fine.

In conclusion, thank you, character of Miranda Priestly, for inspiring about not smiling.

reading (Your money or your life) book by robin and dominguez.
it mentions the "external yardstick" to measure success.

and at the same time yesterday I had been reading (The 8th Habit) book by Covey, and strikes me it calls this same thing "the social mirror".

nice. two different books and they talk about the same thing with different words. 

AKA "keeping up with the Joneses".

empowering because they tackle the same topic from different angles.

In conclusion, now I have two or three different ways to describe this paradigm. Whereas a few years ago I had 0 or 1 ways to describe it.

Writing a letter. Like a note. Like on paper. Like with a pencil and pen.
that is the point of this here blog post, here:

Do it.
Write a letter to the next “professional networking face to face meeting” persona. It may just be the friendly gap-filling medium that I seek for this type of networking. Depending on the person in question. As it is offline , no screen time required, and not in-your-face, and yet stilll a valid way to send a message 
Oddly I sort of never really got started with this medium as I was born in 70's and 80's decades. Nor dare I say any medium, but maybe now I should just stick with the basics, get back to the basics. Nay, Move on forward with the basics!!!

In conclusion, move forward and make writing a paper pencil note cool again. do it. it may be the best way for networking in many circumstances. It flies in the face of digital/screen culture. I will write and the ink/graphite will actually hit the paper. I will feel the paper in my hand. The paper will feel, and smell, and sound, like paper. the note recipient will also be able to feel the paper in their hand, and hear it swish/crinkle, and smell the papery smell of the paper.
That is actually a huge point of this blog post. the simple idea that paper has a feel/smell/sound. Where an email doesn't have a feel/smell/sound.

Money is separate from everything. And yet it is intertwined and integrated with everything.
Let me say it again, money is separate from everything. But at the same time it is intertwine and integrated with everything else.

This is what is so fascinating about it.
This is why money means 1000 different things if you ask 1000 different people what it means.
because it’s amazing because in one sense someone can give another person $100,000 in one second in one transaction.
But in another sense, it would take someone working full-time four years of salary in order to get $100,000.
So when it changed place in one second, it was separate from everything in an extreme case.
But when someone worked four years full-time at a work – for – money job to get the same amount of money, it was intertwined with their entire life for those four years.
Amazing. Insane. Money can be a great equalizer. But it also can create great disparity.

FIN.

Here are some notes from playing the rich dad cashflow classic game online in 2022.

<a href="https://www.richdad.com/classic">https://www.richdad.com/classic</a>



~~~~~~~~ start 2022-08-28 1793 notes:
- it turns out i may want to have some \"FU\" money on hand. Why? Because I frequently hit \"downsized\" penalty randomly. and if i don't have \"FU\" money equal to at least one month's expenses, then I have to take a loan out at 10%. And that's a high rate.
- I some loans at 5% and 3% and 2% and 1% as well. 
- so now i constantly look for deals that are more than 5%.  (or more, like more than 10% ideally)
- Interesting. I am reminded like last time. I see a real estate deal. (big deal) \"4-plex for sale\". and it says (cost $100,000), (cash flow $800), (down pay $20,000).
And the interesting part is I don't need to know nor consider the \"Cost\" part. Amazing. Rich dad game designer is trying to teach us, and is teaching us, that you only really need to look at the cash flow and the down pay. So I calculate it as (800 / 20000 = 0.04) so that means this deal would flow me 4%. 
so ok but not stellar. But I would buy this deal before I repayed a 3% loan for example. But I wouldn't buy this deal before I repayed a 5% loan.
- so literally in this game at this point I have a \"home mortgage payment\" that is ($400 / $47,000 = .009) so = less than 1%.
and then a car loan payment that is ($100 / $5,000 = 0.02) so = 2%
and then a credit card payment that is ($90 / $3,000 = 0.03) so = 3%
just for comparison.
- huh. ok, so that means that, if i could save up enough money, then, i actually would want to take the 4% deal first before any of my those 3x current debts. ok good to know, glad I calculated them out. will do.
- ok but i also now am trying to figure, if it is worth it to pay off lower loans ealier _simpy because i will need to take a lot of turns_ and likelihood is greater that I will amass greater irreversible liabilities with greater turns. maybe. huh.
- so i saw a real estate that would flow 3.7%. and I was just a couple hundred dollars short of being able to afford it. and so I actually DID take out a loan of $1000 .
and my plan was because this deal doesn't come around every turn and I thought i could possibly pay off the loan my next turn.
it turns out it worked! i bought the 3.7% deal then I payed off the 10% loan the next turn. so i squeaked by and leveraged that debt!
it worked because my payday each turn at that moment was $1,080. so it allowed me some leeway.
however. caveat. in doing so i did ALSO temporarily lose my \"FU money\" too. so I went all the way down to $0 cash now temporarily.
But was it worth it all told?
i'm going to say yes initially now atm.
because I got that asset flowing 3.7% which is soooo money. literally it's money.
In short, the lesson learned is how to leverage debt with a reasonable amount of risk.
thank you for this lesson rich dad.
- ok new lesson. maybe happened 1x before but i had forgotten. i had a 3/2 house. and someone 'offered to buy' it from me. and that ended in a profit of ~$30,000 for me. because i had payed maybe 65000 and they offered 95000 maybe. so it turns out that it does matter in this case the \"cost\" part of the deal sometimes. and this time.
anyways needless to say i took the deal. because $30,000 is pretty hard to earn in this game. and leveraging larger amounts of cash (such as $30,000) is relatively easy.  
and so now its looking good as long as no disasters then i'm betting i'll soon be able to leverage this $30,000 into some larger real estate deal at 4% or higher. fingers crossed.
- hmm, next turn a deal comes on for 2.5% for $20,000. I'm gonna pass. don't know if i'll regret it. but i'm really holding out for 4% or higher.
- ok. pivotal moment. I have $38,010 cash. and i get an offer (Cost: $200,000) (Cash flow: $1,600) (Down pay: $40,000). That would be cash flow of 4% each turn. ($1,600 each turn). and so it's pretty money in this game. I'm going for it. However I will need to take out $2,000 loan (at 10% as usual) in order to swing it. but fine. i think i will be able to swing that and pay that $2,000 off within maybe 2 turns or so (especially given my new $1,600 per month will be coming in I'm calculating!).
Do it.
- ok. it seems to have worked and now my passive income is up to $1,600 per turn.
huh, i thought that might make me win the game at that pont.
but no. even though I now have $2,180 cash coming in every. single. payday. even so, i'm not done yet. 
why? ah, i see my monthly expenses each turn are $2,520. and so even though I'm bringing in $4,700 each turn, that's not quite enough. 
because, reviewing, i see the rule is that i will need per-turn passive income exceeding my per-turn expenses. 
welp, looks like i still need to reduce my expenses and/or increase my cash-flowing assets.
onwards!
- i saw a 4.8% deal. (couldn't afford it atm but saw it). it was (\"apartment house for sale\") (Cost: $350,000) (Cash flow: $2,400) (Down Pay: $50,000). impressive returns. but too steep of a down pay for me right now. even all told. so need to pass.
- next i gobble up a 4% deal (Cost: $45,000) (Cash flow: $320) (Down pay: $8,000). done. onwards.
nice. now i got even more cash flowing in each turn. and also my progress bar is way up. 
up to $1920 per turn. Whereas my total expenses per turn are now $2320.
I'm gonna win soon in the next few turns, if I can get a bit more ($400 per turn more) passive income unless some tragedy.
- hmm. or i could soon pay off that 2% car loan. ... on second thought nah, i guess in the spirit of the game it would be more effective to look for another 4% asset instead of paying off the 2% loan. ...or would it? depends because i have to pay $100 every single turn because of that car loan. hmm, nah. still better mathematically to look for the 4% investment i do judge.
- notes to self at this point. 
1.) Salary is still appreciated, however it is MUCH LESS important now than it had been before. relatively. i mean the more passive income i get the less i feel i need my salary work income!
2.) Also when I get \"downsized\" (it happens again a few times), it hurts WAY LESS. too. nice.
the lesson the cash flow game is again reinforcing is, passive income is king. cash flowing assets are king. golden. point taken. Again thank you for the lesson, cash flow classic borad game!
- very interesting. an asset (big deal) comes around with a 5% return. \"limited partner wanted\". but it does have a steep Down pay. I judge I cannot afford it atm. but here are the details for posterity: \"non-franchise sandwich shop...\" (Cost: $30,000) (Cash flow: $1,500) (Down pay: $30,000).
- haha! i leverage $1000 loan once again. to get that final $400 of cash flow that I had been seeking. bought it.
now actually as soon as I pay off that $1000 loan (which I can now immediately at my next turn since my payday atm is up to $3000 per turn now). now I'll win!  yasss!!!!!
- lol i did it but yet another lesson in 'counting one's chickens'. my expenses now atm exactly equal my income. both at $2,320.
But the nuance is that i'm not out of the rat race yet. I was too giddy and forgot. I need MORE THAN ENOUGH passive income to win. so at least another $1 of passive income. 😅
- interesting. I am offfered a deal a buyer wants to buy my 'plexes'.
but at this point i am $1 short of probably winning the game. and so even though I may get tens of thousands of dollars of cash from these deals, then i will say no atm.
owever i don't rememver what was my cost on those anyways. so it maybe unwise in any case. so definitely pass now. 
in any case i noticed i am feeling less risk-takery since i want to hold onto my cash cow properties atm.
- ok nice. i'm out of the rat race and on the fast track. now trying to get my dream or else get my passive income to more than $50,000 of previous.
but. interesting. the new deals i'm seeing are still only 3.3% or 4.x% etc. etc. so i do still need to be very discerning I see. good to know that deals don't get any sweeter even when you get richer. lessson ponit taken.
- OMG!! 'Divorce! Lose all your cash!' LOL. i lost $1,234,900 (so over 1 million) in a divorce in this point of the game ! ouch! LOL !! what a curveball. lesson here is that life trumps money sometimes, life can still push 'rich people' around. !!
- LOL i got divorced again and at this point again lost hundreds of thousands of dollars! 
but i was actually prepped for that/ trained. i made sure to buy some more assets in between divorces. whew! good thing divorces in this game only mean cash lost, not assets lost.
- LOL! \"lawsuit\; lose half your cash\". amazing. another ~$130,000 lost just now. good lesson i guess!
- LOL! a third divorce. lost all cash again (lost another $500,000 or so).
- ok finally i won by getting my dream \"stock market for kids\" start a financial educaiton company. and it cost $125,000. which i did have on hand at that moment.
YAY! done this 1x round and learned a lot as ususal.
~~~~~~~~ end 2022-08-28 1793 notes



--------------------------------
ok now a few nights later i again played cashflow classic online. and with this new strategy learned from the above notes.
and then i further still leveraged those ideas. and so the further notes from that session a few nights later here were my notes:
START FEW NIGHTS LATER NOTES: ---------------------
"2022-08-29 1915 cash flow game scratch notes.txt
home mortgage 1330 / 143000 =  1%
car loan 300 / 15000 =         2%
credit card 660 / 22000 =      3%
retail 50 / 1000 =             5%
2340 total expenses (loans/debt that is)
plus taxes 2350 so total is:
4690
plus other expenses 2210 so total is:
6900
ok so getting the greedy/smart idea here.
i took out an $11,000 loan in order to leverage this real estate deal.
that means i will now owe about $1000 extra per month in loan payments.
but so why i did this is my salary income currrently is about $2000 per month. 
and so i plan to leverage that. 
and so now if it goes to plan, i have the asset now which is golden because it immediately starts flowing money.
and now i do however have to quick as possible pay down that $11,000 loan. if possible i will pay down $1000 per (2x turns) so it will take me ~20 turns to pay it off. (eek). or less since my income will become larger relative to my expenses each time I pay off a bit of my loan. (again, if all goes to plan...)
I will update here after ~20 turns.
ok, update is that after about 14 turns I was able to repay that $11,000 loan. so now I own that property outright and it is still flowing cash!.
wow, a new aspect of the game neat!
but i assume it did take luck too. especially i may have been lucky.
and I only leveraged about 50% of my salary income. so kept it down to 14 turns and not much more!
wow I saw a 6.2% 4-plex deal. but couldn't actually afford it so had to pass.
wow so this time i probably played ~25-30m. total and got out of the rat race then wone the game.
whearas last time last night (or the night before), i took probably ~60m. or more.
END FEW NIGHTS LATER NOTES



----------------------------------
ok sometime later (probably 2022-8-28/ 2022-08-30, until 2022-9-11. probably a week and a half later.
i play again. and here are the further notes:
"2022-09-11 0627 
ok this time going to play rich dad classic game online again.
this time something new.
i make a spreadsheet at the beginning of the game with three columns. time, income, and expenses.
and so why is i want to, every 5 minutes, note down my income and expenses.
so i can see my progression and see (if) how long it takes me to get out of the rat race.
in conclusion, the spreadsheet tracking is the new thing. i had long since busted out my calculator for this game. now my spreadsheet. now both calculator and spreadsheet. it's on!
note: 30 minutes of this. i also started tracking on this sheet ( payday, passive income, and total income). also every 5 minutes.
I set formulas to do summation on the spreadsheet.
also i used the spreadsheet side area for calculating percentages for loans rates etc.
time|income|expenses|Payday|passive income|total income
06:25:00 AM|||||$0
06:30:00 AM|$13,200|$8,900|$4,300||$4,300
06:35:00 AM|||||$0
06:40:00 AM|$13,200|$8,900|||$0
06:45:00 AM|$13,800|$10,290|$3,420|$600|$4,020
06:50:00 AM|$14,050|$10,130|$3,920|$850|$4,770
06:55:00 AM|$14,800|$10,130|$4,670|$1,600|$6,270
07:00:00 AM|$14,800|$9,860|$4,940|$1,600|$6,540
07:05:00 AM|$17,300|$9,960|$7,340|$4,100|$11,440
also now I am leveraging debt like i started doing the last two times.
leveraging 10% loans in order to afford a rental house sooner than otherwise able. (but paying off that 10% loan asap)
also now i realized i have already bought about 4 or 5 rental houses. but. now i still am halfway out of the rat race.  (4100 out of 9960)
and so now I decide i want to save up cash and look for a GOOD DEAL. 
for example i see a deal flowing 2%. so nah.
I'll calculate the rate of return for each deal and wait for one that is 5% or more. is my plan now. 
ok i bought some 5% and 5% deals.
ok i am playing. and then now. i suddenly see I owe a $19,000 loan (10% loan). that i had lost track. i thought I owed no loan. :eek:.
lesson here is to keep track of your loans. i think this one almost drowned me.
ok. next. I borrowed about $27,000 to leverage a 5.3% cash-flowing rental property. and then. within the next 3 turns i payed that loan off. because my income is $9,000 or so per turn/month. nice.
time|income|expenses|Payday|passive income|total income
06:25:00 AM|||||$0
06:30:00 AM|$13,200|$8,900|$4,300||$4,300
06:35:00 AM|||||$0
06:40:00 AM|$13,200|$8,900|||$0

06:50:00 AM|$14,050|$10,130|$3,920|$850|$4,770
06:55:00 AM|$14,800|$10,130|$4,670|$1,600|$6,270
07:00:00 AM|$14,800|$9,860|$4,940|$1,600|$6,540
07:05:00 AM|$17,300|$9,960|$7,340|$4,100|$11,440
07:10:00 AM|||||
07:15:00 AM|$19,200|$12,460|$6,740|$6,000|$12,740
07:20:00 AM|$19,200|$10,260|$8,940|$6,000|$14,940
07:25:00 AM|$20,900|$9,860|$11,040|$7,700|$18,740
07:30:00 AM|$20,900|$9,860|$11,040|$7,700|$18,740
07:35:00 AM|$24,900|$11,160|$13,740|$11,700|$25,440
ok done. $11,700 passive income reached. whereas my expenses are $11,160



In conclusion, these have been some notes from playing the rich dad cashflow classic game online in 2022.

<h3 id="2022-12-19_2145-relevant-book-richest-babylon"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-12-19_2145-relevant-book-richest-babylon">96 Years Later Content Still Relevant from Book The Richest Man in Babylon</a></h3>

I'm laughing my butt off!

ok so i listedned to the audio book "The richest man in babylon" and at the first chapter after the foreward, the chapter called "The Man Who Desired Gold", it starts to tell the fictional story of Bansir the chariot maker and his friend Kobi.
They start talking about hey how come they're working so hard and yet they aren't rich, their purses are essentially bare they don't even have two shekels (i.e. they are living paycheck to paycheck, equivalent).

And i'm laughing my butt off!

this book The Richest Man In Babylon was written in 1926. 
and it is describing me.
me who was born 50 years later.
And now its 90 years later.
amazing.

and it is so satirical too, that makes me laugh.

nice.

I pause it now. I want to pause it and tell my friends and family.

and ask them if they want to listen to the the audio book with me.

because already i can tell, that it is 1.) entertaning and 2.) educating.

and I think it will be a great story we may be able to learn and enjoy together with friends and family.

and i love it how satirical it is and the language is like "thy" and "thine" and "

Some quotes from the book at this point:

"...his slow mind was struggling patiently with a problem for which he could find no answer..." 

"...so generous thou needest not to labour..."

And I see this work "The Richest Man in Babylon" is in public domain so I can quote and re-print an excerpt of it here.

<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AThe_Richest_Man_In_Babylon.pdf&page=3">https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AThe_Richest_Man_In_Babylon.pdf&page=3</a>

And here is the quote of the part that especially made me chuckle because it is from 90 years ago, and on top of that the fictional story depicted therein is from 4000 years ago or so. And yet it seems to be describing my life today in 2022 which is what makes it funny and sad at the same time:

" ...may the gods bless thee with great liberality, my friend..." "... yet it does appear they have already been so generous thou needest not to labour. I rejoice with thee in thy good fortune. More, I would even share it with thee. Pray, from thy purse, which must be bulging else thou wouldst be busy in your shop, extract but two humble shekels and lend them to me until after the nobelman's feast this night. Thou wilt not miss them ere they are returned. .... If I did have two shekels... Bansir responded... ..."

In conclusion, I listened to the audiobook of "The Richest Man in Babylon" and LMAO it somehow uncanny described my own life today even though it was written 90 years ago. But I'm grateful that I hear this story so I can learn from the lessons therein.

Some ideas for my next dream job:

- I envision I'll have the ability to do the job and I am willing to do the job. Also I'll act, and be, professional ongoing, so as to not drive my employer crazy. Ditto for my peers in this role.

- I'll find a profitable company that is a good company to work for. The company is growing organically. There is an abundance of work to be done, and customers are willing to pay, and do pay, a full fair price, for my company's products and services.

- The role doesn't induce burnout by its design by its nature, and the job is sustainable ongoing indefinitely when done at a rate of between 20-50 hours per week. Ditto for my peers' jobs in this role.

- There is a clear path to ₷¤730 silver bams per year within ~3 years or so. (that means 2x basic yearly living expenses). Ditto for my peers in this role.

- Envisioned that I find the job by referral from someone I know who tninks I'm a professional person.

- Envisioned that the person refers me to the job has some mastery of the job and is training me as an apprentice to do the same job they are doing.

- My employment "job" may actually be 1x full time job, or else 1x or more part time jobs, and/or I'm part-owner or owner of the company.

- A job with some in-person element to the job.

I'm calling this 'Episode 3'. Episode 2 would have been this old post:
"My Career Path Over the Next Few Years"

2022-12-06 1408

<h2 id="2022-12-06_1408-first-10-k-cvs"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-12-06_1408-first-10-k-cvs">I Read My First 10-K Report that is the CVS 10-K report from the year 2021</a></h2>


Long story short, I DID IT! I READ  MY FIRST 10-K REPORT!!!

Let me start over. I have been gearing up towards learning how to read a 10-K Report, and towards reading my first 10-K report. A 10-K report is a comprehensive annual report published by every public company.

Here, for the purpose of informing you and maybe even entertaining you, I will share with you about this experience.

As for which company to pick, I decided it should be a company I like and that I want to learn more about.

I like CVS. I get snacks and treats there, and prescriptions, and I am considering applying to work as an employee at CVS too. 

In October I happened to be in Las Vegas, and from the entryway of a CVS on 'The Strip', I looked out through the glass doors, and saw the Bellagio fountains spouting up across the street. It was surreal:

<a href="./uploads/2022-10-19-bellagio-cvs.jpg">./uploads/2022-10-19-bellagio-cvs.jpg</a>

I like the CVS brand and company enough, that I even bought a share of CVS stock. I am privileged to do this, and I hope everyone else can too, if they do so wish.


And so, without further ado, here are 5x interesting things that I learned by reading the CVS 10-K report from the year 2021, followed by 3x special notes.

Interesting thing number 1.)
Starting on a positive note, I enjoyed seeing a lot of transparent solid numbers pulished inside this 10-K report, about balance sheets, revenues, operating costs, and much much more.
One thing that stood out to me:
'...As of February 2, 2022, the number of registered holders of the registrant’s common stock were 24,946 ....'
And this feels empowering to me, that nominally anyone who wants to, can own and hold a piece of the company.

Interesting thing number 2.)
CVS doesn't own many of their retail store facilities, rather they lease or rent 95% of these spaces. Who knew?! I guess they're not in the real estate business after all. But interesting to know.

Interesting thing number 3.)
I learned the pharmacy is a major profit center for CVS, includidng pharmacy by mail, as opposed to the front-of-store goods sales. I guess those snacks and treats I buy there aren't contributing as much as I thought to the company's bottom line after all! But yum!

Interesting thing number 4.)
I learned that CVS Health Corp is also a full-on health insurance company and that they own Aetna. Also I learned the U.S. Federal Government is a significant customer of CVS Health Corp. I find this very interesting.

Interesting thing number 5.)
I saw a lot in the 10-K report about "derivatives" and about hedging and risk, and also about a "Repurchse Program", these in the context of millions, or BILLIONS, of dollars.
These seemed important, but also scary to me.
For now, I'll make a note to myself to learn more, and I'll try and block out the visions that are popping up in my head, from the movie 'The Big Short' With Steve Carell, when I hear these words 'derivatives' and 'hedging'.


And now finally, as promised, here are 3x additional special notes, about my experience with The 10-K report and with CVS:

Special note 1.)

I Learned how to read a 10-K, including how to navigate it with the Table of Contents, and including an example of what information may be found therein.

Special note 2.)

Perhaps most thrilling to me personally, is that having read 1x 10-K report, I feel empowered with a strong foundation and a baseline, to go ahead and read my second 10-K report. I'm giddy with anticipation, about what similarities and differences that I'll find, upon reading my next 10-K report for my next company, and about what I will learn tomorrow!

Special note 3.)

Not long after reading this CVS 10-K, I ran into a friend and we talked about CVS and, it was a great conversation where I learned even more about CVS, and where I shared what I knew too. We shared job leads and tips about applying to CVS Health Corp too. And I was grateful for that conversation. Nice.


In conclusion, I learned how to read a 10-K report and I learned a lot about CVS Health Corp. I hope you found some of what I have shared interesting or maybe even entertaining.



Note:
I found the CVS Health Corp "10-K" report on the sec.gov "Edgar" database.
"February 9, 2022 - 10-K: Annual report for year ending December 31, 2021"

<h2>月亮・檸檬媽媽值得注意的語錄一部曲</h2>

Here are three notable or inspiring quotes:


1.) 
‘my definition of intelligence is, if you agree with me then you’re intelligent. (Laughing Ha ha ha ha ha)’ 
- The persona of Robert Kiyosaki
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/richard-duncan-15">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/richard-duncan-15</a>
This is a joke Kiyosaki frequently makes on his podcast. And it never gets old for me, I smile every time, especially because he laughs every time he says it. Classic.


2.)
‘there are 1 million ways to get rich. But, there are 1 billion ways to to go broke.’
- The persona of Robert Kiyosaki
(on his rich dad radio podcast sometime between 2020 and 2022) 
—-Morgan’s note: he saying that there an abundance of ways to get rich. At the same time he’s also saying hey but you do have to choose at least one of those ways and go do it and have a plan and put in the work. Because guess what, there’s even more ways to fail to get rich, to stay poor,or to go broke.


3.)
‘intuition is knowing what you know, without knowing why you know it’
- The persona of Ashley Stahl

1.) Sleep. 

That’s it. Sleep.

In other words whenever I feel triggered or compelled to drink a cup of coffee, at that moment, I need to take a nap.

For lite coffee habit then maybe just nap 20mins at a time over a week. 

But for a more entrenched coffee habit, or addiction, I daresay estimate may need to nap 5 hours a day at the beginning, and then keep napping as needed, naps of shortening lengths, for 6 months, in order to kick the coffee drinking addiction.

What this also means is probably taking some hours off of work and clearing my weekend schedules and dropping a lot of activities off my calendar. Especially at least in the beginning of the 6-month-long coffee rehab period. 
But. It's worth it for not being addicted to coffee for health's sake! 
These dropped activities and work can be added back on later, after kicking the coffee habit.

In conclusion, to kick a coffee habit, sleep.

Correction: in conclusion, to kick a coffee habit, don't start drinking coffee in the first place. 
Otherwise, to kick a coffee habit, sleep.

Yes this. 

Excellent, nice.

The guest says think of the stock market like dating guys; the stock market goes up on average 10% per year, and that is like for example she dates on average 10 guys per year, maybe some years maybe 0 guys, maybe 20 guys, but on average maybe 10 guys per year.

Love it how the guest Amanda Holden talking with the host Jamila Souffrant are having a good time and empowering folks by making this analogy between stock market investing and dating!

PSA re-blogging about "The White-space Day". Because this came up again and again. Now. Years later. And it’s very empowering. So it has staying power so I want to resurface it on my latest blog again.

In short, the persona in the blog post is distracted, is walking the dog but not enjoying it as usual.

They realize it and call this 'the overwhelm'. And, and thereupon, the persona the writer says they have a cure for this, that is 'a complete white-space day'.

That's where they take a day to mostly rest and relax and maybe tidy up and declutter including what they in a linked blog post call "To-do list zero", and then go walk the dog again and now enjoy it.

Morgan: This blog post is excellent. Thank you to the author for having put to words how to recognize this and how to know what needs to be done. It has helped me.

I want folks, like kids, to retire first, then go to college.

If they want to.

no, seriously.

Envision that each kid has ₷¤14,700 silver-bams in an investment that flows 5% per year.

So that flows ₷¤735 per year.

So that’s it, end of story.

Ok more details of the story:

So say the kid is savvy enough to not touch that ₷¤14,700 principal.

And so now they are flowing themselves 735 silver-bams per year.

And so they can if they live frugally they can just retire. Before they ever worked a day necessarily.

If they want to.

But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Because now the kid is retired.
And so they can now in their early early retirement, they can pursue anything they want for example they can go to college first thing.
And then after they go to college, they can get a job and work for money.

In other words if I'm savvy enough, even if I'm a kid, I can still have a normal life, and yet be retired at the same time.

Obviously this would be the smart way to do things if a kid can swing it.

And only if the kid wants to.

But I know life gets in the way and life happens. So maybe it won’t work for everyone.

Plus the kid has to surf frugality ongoing to make this happen. And that’s not for everyone.

But it’s one way to do it!

The book says save one tenth of my income.

‘The richest man in Babylon ‘ audiobook 
Chapter 3 — cure #1 for a lean purse
The character says to save 1/10 of the gold that enters thy purse. 

It says do spend, but only spend, 9/10 ongoing. And don't feel bad about spending the 9/10 because I already first saved 1/10 for a better life.

Morgan: I heard this same book is famous for 'pay yourself first' idea.
And here it is.
But moreupon, it says how much percentage to save. 

So in short, the idea is to, each time I get money coming in from income, first, before paying any bills, it's recommended to first set aside 1/10 of that into savings.
The book goes on to say also set aside 2/10 towards re-paying any loans/debt, if I have any loans.
It also goes on to say that 1/10 should best be invested in some project that will return additional profit back to me as well.

Morgan: Hmm that is interesting.

In conclusion, save one tenth.

<h2 id="2022-10-14_1157-worker-salaries"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-14_1157-worker-salaries">Worker Salaries are Cost of Goods Sold Whereas Corporate Salaries are Operating Expenses</a></h2>

If I understand, workers/laborers salaries under standard accounting paradigm are part of 'cost of goods sold' whereas corporate / executive / manager salaries under this standard paradigm are part of 'operating expenses'.

OK I learned this fact from from the motley fool money podcast episode from April 2nd 2022. It’s so mind blowing of a dichotomy that it deserves its own blog post.:

Guide to Financial Statements (1 of 2) Apr 02, 2022 (19:16) 
<a href="https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/2022-04-02-guide-to-financial-statements-1-of">https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/2022-04-02-guide-to-financial-statements-1-of</a>

—-the “cost of goods sold “ on the income statement .  workers salaries are part of the cost of goods sold.

—-the “operating expenses.” on the income statement . the salaries at headquarters (if i understand etc. the CEO’s salary is part of _operating expenses_ on the income statement. NOT part of Cost of goods sold)

…so basically the wage laborers and the workers are part of the product? 
…whereas the executives are part of the __(operation?)____ ?

LOL. workers are nouns. pawns. static. 
whereas executives and management are verbs. people who get things done. 
amazing. so telling. I can keep this in mind when looking for my next company. and when looking for my next job role.

Anyways its good to learn this fact.

Because I like to learn how the world really works.

Need to know how the world really works, then I can proceed to apply my own decisions and make informed decisions and steer my life accordingly.

In conclusion, I learned today that in a standard corporate paradigm worker wages are cost of goods sold on the accounting sheet whereas corporate employee salaries are part of operating expenses.

<h2 id="2022-10-14_1133-pe-ratio"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-14_1133-pe-ratio">Two Notes on P/E Ratio</a></h2>

Two notes on P/E Ratio.

First.

In this podcast episode, the guest Brian Feroldi, just after the 27 minute mark, says that sometime after 2005 he had passed on Salesforce Inc (CRM) because he had seen its valuation (P/E Ratio) was about 140, however now he regrets it because since then the company's stock price increased 33 times. ( a 33-bagger).

Rule Breaker Investing podcast —- (2021-09-22) “Market Cap Game Show…” 
<a href="https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2021-09-22-the-market-cap-game-show-brian-vs">https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2021-09-22-the-market-cap-game-show-brian-vs</a>

In other words, in this first example stood out because it was an example of one time when a high P/E ratio turned out to still be a good buy. (in hindsight only).

However this may be an exception. It's understood that most folks most times, do (and rightly do) avoid buying a stock whose P/E Ratio valuation is too high.

So food for thought.

Second.

Second note to think about regarding P/E ratio.

2021-04-07 rich dad radio podcast episode. At about the 20-minute mark.
They talk about how Japan's equities bubble in the 1990's.
Stocks were trading at 100x p/e ratio in this bubble in the 90s, they say.
The P/E ratio of more than one company stock, at the time in this country, was just one indicator of a wider economic problem at the time.

"The Feds are Creating a Liquidity Tsunami - Rich Dad Radio Show"
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000516094459">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000516094459</a>

And so in this second example, it is congruent with the first. They are saying that if the P/E Ratios for stocks are too high, then it's a bad sign, it's a sign of a concern and generally in these cases one should be careful.

In conclusion this has been a note about P/E ratios, for better or for worse. We learned something about P/E ratios. Namely P/E ratio is one way to value a company, and also namely that if P/E Ratios get too high then it may be a concern. For one example by the time one company's P/E Ratio got to 140 then one person judged that was already much too high for their tastes. This we have learned from this blog post.

Paradigm with humility how to view life:

Each moment going through time, I should view life as if the default state is me standing by myself alone outside in wilderness. And so keep that in mind that is the default human condition.

In this paradigm I always need to be proactive to do things like the following:
1.) Seek out family and friends and help them and share with them ongoing proactively. These relationships need to be found and maintained.
2.) Proactively ongoing work towards getting and maintaining compfortable shelter and clothing and food. These things need to be retained and maintained.
3.) If I want other more specific stuff like stock share of a company, or a hot cup of starbucks coffee in my hand, or a car full of gas parked in the lot to use on demand, etc, etc, then I also need to be proactive to get, and maintain, those as well. As these don't come by default.

That's it really, just that I need to remember these things don't come by default; I'm not entitled to any of these as an earthling. 

I need to get and maintain these, if I don't want to be alone in the wilderness standing or huddling under a bridge somewhere.

Default state ISN'T that I'm comfy in my house with a hot starbucks coffee that I just drove car full of gas to get, and family and friends who love me with me, and we're sitting on the couch watching a funny show and we have ₷¤5,882 silver bams in the bank and we have 10,000 shares of stock of my faviorite companies and my job is going well and my colleagues automaticalloy reach out and help me when they see I'm not up to par at work. 

The default state ISN'T that one of abundance sitting on the couch with a great situation by default. 
All those things need work to get and maintain. 
And ultimately I need to be the one to go and get them and maintain them. 
I can get help from others too, but, I need to do my share which isn't trivial share of the work, and I need to be proactive to help myself and also proactive to help others.

In conclusion I need to more use the humility paradigm and stay proactive like "who moved my cheese"*. Not reactive and entitled like the other failed character(s) from "who moved my cheese".

<h2 id="2022-10-13_2107"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-13_2107">October 2022 - One Way How To Invest</a></h2>\

One way how to invest.

16 Bullet-points.

Note that these are mostly taken from fool.com Motley Fool ecosystem.

However they were never all 16x of them mentioned all in 1x Motley Fool essay or podcast-episode to my knowledge. 

And so it is really a summary of multiple Motley Fool philosophies, all mashed up into one summary/compilation here by me. 

Furthermore at least two of these are my (Morgan's) own suggestions not a Motley Fool suggestion per se. And so it really is a new list that is most/part Motley Fool philosopies but part Morgan philosophies too.

Without further ado:

1 • Buy a stock with 10% of each paycheck.

2 • Mom, dad, kids -- each takes a turn buying a stock.

3 • Each person holds GKC [Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum] number of stocks. (same number as their age)

4 • Choose a company where you personally had a great consumer experience.

5 • Choose a company that yields a dividend.

6 • Choose a company that's the only one doing what they're doing (niche).

7 • Choose a company thats stock price has been rising steadily recently.

8 • Choose a company that has a healthy balance sheet including its cash and debt.

9 • Choose a company that he P/E ratio *and true earnings growth potential* align and is high (between ~12 and ~78.)

10 • Choose a company that solves a real world problem.

11 • Choose a company that values win-win-win for all stakeholders.

12 • Choose a company with a long-term orientation.

13 • Choose a company that moreso evolves ongoing.

14 • Choose a company that cultivates good management.

15 • Choose a company that cultivates a great brand.

16 • Choose a company where people are habitually seeing it as overvalued.


In conclusion, this is one way how to invest in October 2022, in 16 bullet-points numbered list.

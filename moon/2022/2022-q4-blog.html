<h2 id="2022-10-14_1133-pe-ratio"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-14_1133-pe-ratio">Two Notes on P/E Ratio</a></h2>

Two notes on P/E Ratio.

First.

In this podcast episode, the guest Brian Feroldi, just after the 27 minute mark, says that sometime after 2005 he had passed on Salesforce Inc (CRM) because he had seen its valuation (P/E Ratio) was about 140, however now he regrets it because since then the company's stock price increased 33 times. ( a 33-bagger).

Rule Breaker Investing podcast —- (2021-09-22) “Market Cap Game Show…” 
<a href="https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2021-09-22-the-market-cap-game-show-brian-vs">https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2021-09-22-the-market-cap-game-show-brian-vs</a>

In other words, in this first example stood out because it was an example of one time when a high P/E ratio turned out to still be a good buy. (in hindsight only).

However this may be an exception. It's understood that most folks most times, do (and rightly do) avoid buying a stock whose P/E Ratio valuation is too high.

So food for thought.

Second.

Second note to think about regarding P/E ratio.

2021-04-07 rich dad radio podcast episode. At about the 20-minute mark.
They talk about how Japan's equities bubble in the 1990's.
Stocks were trading at 100x p/e ratio in this bubble in the 90s, they say.
The P/E ratio of more than one company stock, at the time in this country, was just one indicator of a wider economic problem at the time.

"The Feds are Creating a Liquidity Tsunami - Rich Dad Radio Show"
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000516094459">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000516094459</a>

And so in this second example, it is congruent with the first. They are saying that if the P/E Ratios for stocks are too high, then it's a bad sign, it's a sign of a concern and generally in these cases one should be careful.

In conclusion this has been a note about P/E ratios, for better or for worse. We learned something about P/E ratios. Namely P/E ratio is one way to value a company, and also namely that if P/E Ratios get too high then it may be a concern. For one example by the time one company's P/E Ratio got to 140 then one person judged that was already much too high for their tastes. This we have learned from this blog post.

<h2 id="2022-10-13_2114"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-13_2114">Paradigm With Humility How To View Life</a></h2>

Paradigm with humility how to view life:

Each moment going through time, I should view life as if the default state is me standing by myself alone outside in wilderness. And so keep that in mind that is the default human condition.

In this paradigm I always need to be proactive to do things like the following:
1.) Seek out family and friends and help them and share with them ongoing proactively. These relationships need to be found and maintained.
2.) Proactively ongoing work towards getting and maintaining compfortable shelter and clothing and food. These things need to be retained and maintained.
3.) If I want other more specific stuff like stock share of a company, or a hot cup of starbucks coffee in my hand, or a car full of gas parked in the lot to use on demand, etc, etc, then I also need to be proactive to get, and maintain, those as well. As these don't come by default.

That's it really, just that I need to remember these things don't come by default; I'm not entitled to any of these as an earthling. 

I need to get and maintain these, if I don't want to be alone in the wilderness standing or huddling under a bridge somewhere.

Default state ISN'T that I'm comfy in my house with a hot starbucks coffee that I just drove car full of gas to get, and family and friends who love me with me, and we're sitting on the couch watching a funny show and we have ₷¤5,882 silver bams in the bank and we have 10,000 shares of stock of my faviorite companies and my job is going well and my colleagues automaticalloy reach out and help me when they see I'm not up to par at work. 

The default state ISN'T that one of abundance sitting on the couch with a great situation by default. 
All those things need work to get and maintain. 
And ultimately I need to be the one to go and get them and maintain them. 
I can get help from others too, but, I need to do my share which isn't trivial share of the work, and I need to be proactive to help myself and also proactive to help others.

In conclusion I need to more use the humility paradigm and stay proactive like "who moved my cheese"*. Not reactive and entitled like the other failed character(s) from "who moved my cheese".

<h2 id="2022-10-13_2107"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-13_2107">October 2022 - One Way How To Invest</a></h2>\

One way how to invest.

16 Bullet-points.

Note that these are mostly taken from fool.com Motley Fool ecosystem.

However they were never all 16x of them mentioned all in 1x Motley Fool essay or podcast-episode to my knowledge. 

And so it is really a summary of multiple Motley Fool philosophies, all mashed up into one summary/compilation here by me. 

Furthermore at least two of these are my (Morgan's) own suggestions not a Motley Fool suggestion per se. And so it really is a new list that is most/part Motley Fool philosopies but part Morgan philosophies too.

Without further ado:

1 • Buy a stock with 10% of each paycheck.

2 • Mom, dad, kids -- each takes a turn buying a stock.

3 • Each person holds GKC [Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum] number of stocks. (same number as their age)

4 • Choose a company where you personally had a great consumer experience.

5 • Choose a company that yields a dividend.

6 • Choose a company that's the only one doing what they're doing (niche).

7 • Choose a company thats stock price has been rising steadily recently.

8 • Choose a company that has a healthy balance sheet including its cash and debt.

9 • Choose a company that he P/E ratio *and true earnings growth potential* align and is high (between ~12 and ~78.)

10 • Choose a company that solves a real world problem.

11 • Choose a company that values win-win-win for all stakeholders.

12 • Choose a company with a long-term orientation.

13 • Choose a company that moreso evolves ongoing.

14 • Choose a company that cultivates good management.

15 • Choose a company that cultivates a great brand.

16 • Choose a company where people are habitually seeing it as overvalued.


In conclusion, this is one way how to invest in October 2022, in 16 bullet-points numbered list.

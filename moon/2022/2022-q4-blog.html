<h2 id="2022-10-13_2107"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-13_2107">October 2022 - One Way How To Invest</a></h2>\

One way how to invest.

16 Bullet-points.

Note that these are mostly taken from fool.com Motley Fool ecosystem.

However they were never all 16x of them mentioned all in 1x Motley Fool essay or podcast-episode to my knowledge. 

And so it is really a summary of multiple Motley Fool philosophies, all mashed up into one summary/compilation here by me. 

Furthermore at least two of these are my (Morgan's) own suggestions not a Motley Fool suggestion per se. And so it really is a new list that is most/part Motley Fool philosopies but part Morgan philosophies too.

Without further ado:

1 • Buy a stock with 10% of each paycheck.

2 • Mom, dad, kids -- each takes a turn buying a stock.

3 • Each person holds GKC [Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum] number of stocks. (same number as their age)

4 • Choose a company where you personally had a great consumer experience.

5 • Choose a company that yields a dividend.

6 • Choose a company that's the only one doing what they're doing (niche).

7 • Choose a company thats stock price has been rising steadily recently.

8 • Choose a company that has a healthy balance sheet including its cash and debt.

9 • Choose a company that he P/E ratio *and true earnings growth potential* align and is high (between ~12 and ~78.)

10 • Choose a company that solves a real world problem.

11 • Choose a company that values win-win-win for all stakeholders.

12 • Choose a company with a long-term orientation.

13 • Choose a company that moreso evolves ongoing.

14 • Choose a company that cultivates good management.

15 • Choose a company that cultivates a great brand.

16 • Choose a company where people are habitually seeing it as overvalued.


In conclusion, this is one way how to invest in October 2022, in 16 bullet-points numbered list.

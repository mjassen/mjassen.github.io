Some ideas for my next dream job:

- I envision I'll have the ability to do the job and I am willing to do the job. Also I'll act, and be, professional ongoing, so as to not drive my employer crazy. Ditto for my peers in this role.

- I'll find a profitable company that is a good company to work for. The company is growing organically. There is an abundance of work to be done, and customers are willing to pay, and do pay, a full fair price, for my company's products and services.

- The role doesn't induce burnout by its design by its nature, and the job is sustainable ongoing indefinitely when done at a rate of between 20-50 hours per week. Ditto for my peers' jobs in this role.

- There is a clear path to ₷¤730 silver bams per year within ~3 years or so. (that means 2x basic yearly living expenses). Ditto for my peers in this role.

- Envisioned that I find the job by referral from someone I know who tninks I'm a professional person.

- Envisioned that the person refers me to the job has some mastery of the job and is training me as an apprentice to do the same job they are doing.

- My employment "job" may actually be 1x full time job, or else 1x or more part time jobs, and/or I'm part-owner or owner of the company.

- A job with some in-person element to the job.

I'm calling this 'Episode 3'. Episode 2 would have been this old post:
"My Career Path Over the Next Few Years"

2022-12-06 1408

<h2 id="2022-12-06_1408-first-10-k-cvs"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-12-06_1408-first-10-k-cvs">I Read My First 10-K Report that is the CVS 10-K report from the year 2021</a></h2>


Long story short, I DID IT! I READ  MY FIRST 10-K REPORT!!!

Let me start over. I have been gearing up towards learning how to read a 10-K Report, and towards reading my first 10-K report. A 10-K report is a comprehensive annual report published by every public company.

Here, for the purpose of informing you and maybe even entertaining you, I will share with you about this experience.

As for which company to pick, I decided it should be a company I like and that I want to learn more about.

I like CVS. I get snacks and treats there, and prescriptions, and I am considering applying to work as an employee at CVS too. 

In October I happened to be in Las Vegas, and from the entryway of a CVS on 'The Strip', I looked out through the glass doors, and saw the Bellagio fountains spouting up across the street. It was surreal:

<a href="./uploads/2022-10-19-bellagio-cvs.jpg">./uploads/2022-10-19-bellagio-cvs.jpg</a>

I like the CVS brand and company enough, that I even bought a share of CVS stock. I am privileged to do this, and I hope everyone else can too, if they do so wish.


And so, without further ado, here are 5x interesting things that I learned by reading the CVS 10-K report from the year 2021, followed by 3x special notes.

Interesting thing number 1.)
Starting on a positive note, I enjoyed seeing a lot of transparent solid numbers pulished inside this 10-K report, about balance sheets, revenues, operating costs, and much much more.
One thing that stood out to me:
'...As of February 2, 2022, the number of registered holders of the registrant’s common stock were 24,946 ....'
And this feels empowering to me, that nominally anyone who wants to, can own and hold a piece of the company.

Interesting thing number 2.)
CVS doesn't own many of their retail store facilities, rather they lease or rent 95% of these spaces. Who knew?! I guess they're not in the real estate business after all. But interesting to know.

Interesting thing number 3.)
I learned the pharmacy is a major profit center for CVS, includidng pharmacy by mail, as opposed to the front-of-store goods sales. I guess those snacks and treats I buy there aren't contributing as much as I thought to the company's bottom line after all! But yum!

Interesting thing number 4.)
I learned that CVS Health Corp is also a full-on health insurance company and that they own Aetna. Also I learned the U.S. Federal Government is a significant customer of CVS Health Corp. I find this very interesting.

Interesting thing number 5.)
I saw a lot in the 10-K report about "derivatives" and about hedging and risk, and also about a "Repurchse Program", these in the context of millions, or BILLIONS, of dollars.
These seemed important, but also scary to me.
For now, I'll make a note to myself to learn more, and I'll try and block out the visions that are popping up in my head, from the movie 'The Big Short' With Steve Carell, when I hear these words 'derivatives' and 'hedging'.


And now finally, as promised, here are 3x additional special notes, about my experience with The 10-K report and with CVS:

Special note 1.)

I Learned how to read a 10-K, including how to navigate it with the Table of Contents, and including an example of what information may be found therein.

Special note 2.)

Perhaps most thrilling to me personally, is that having read 1x 10-K report, I feel empowered with a strong foundation and a baseline, to go ahead and read my second 10-K report. I'm giddy with anticipation, about what similarities and differences that I'll find, upon reading my next 10-K report for my next company, and about what I will learn tomorrow!

Special note 3.)

Not long after reading this CVS 10-K, I ran into a friend and we talked about CVS and, it was a great conversation where I learned even more about CVS, and where I shared what I knew too. We shared job leads and tips about applying to CVS Health Corp too. And I was grateful for that conversation. Nice.


In conclusion, I learned how to read a 10-K report and I learned a lot about CVS Health Corp. I hope you found some of what I have shared interesting or maybe even entertaining.



Note:
I found the CVS Health Corp "10-K" report on the sec.gov "Edgar" database.

<h2>月亮・檸檬媽媽值得注意的語錄一部曲</h2>

Here are three notable or inspiring quotes:


1.) 
‘my definition of intelligence is, if you agree with me then you’re intelligent. (Laughing Ha ha ha ha ha)’ 
- The persona of Robert Kiyosaki
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/richard-duncan-15">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/richard-duncan-15</a>
This is a joke Kiyosaki frequently makes on his podcast. And it never gets old for me, I smile every time, especially because he laughs every time he says it. Classic.


2.)
‘there are 1 million ways to get rich. But, there are 1 billion ways to to go broke.’
- The persona of Robert Kiyosaki
(on his rich dad radio podcast sometime between 2020 and 2022) 
—-Morgan’s note: he saying that there an abundance of ways to get rich. At the same time he’s also saying hey but you do have to choose at least one of those ways and go do it and have a plan and put in the work. Because guess what, there’s even more ways to fail to get rich, to stay poor,or to go broke.


3.)
‘intuition is knowing what you know, without knowing why you know it’
- The persona of Ashley Stahl
<a href="https://journeytolaunch.com/episode276/">https://journeytolaunch.com/episode276/</a>
Also Stahl says this quote again/too in her book as well <a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/14421184">You Turn</a>


In conclusion, this was moon notable quotes episode 1.

1.) Sleep. 

That’s it. Sleep.

In other words whenever I feel triggered or compelled to drink a cup of coffee, at that moment, I need to take a nap.

For lite coffee habit then maybe just nap 20mins at a time over a week. 

But for a more entrenched coffee habit, or addiction, I daresay estimate may need to nap 5 hours a day at the beginning, and then keep napping as needed, naps of shortening lengths, for 6 months, in order to kick the coffee drinking addiction.

What this also means is probably taking some hours off of work and clearing my weekend schedules and dropping a lot of activities off my calendar. Especially at least in the beginning of the 6-month-long coffee rehab period. 
But. It's worth it for not being addicted to coffee for health's sake! 
These dropped activities and work can be added back on later, after kicking the coffee habit.

In conclusion, to kick a coffee habit, sleep.

Correction: in conclusion, to kick a coffee habit, don't start drinking coffee in the first place. 
Otherwise, to kick a coffee habit, sleep.

Yes this. 

Excellent, nice.

The guest says think of the stock market like dating guys; the stock market goes up on average 10% per year, and that is like for example she dates on average 10 guys per year, maybe some years maybe 0 guys, maybe 20 guys, but on average maybe 10 guys per year.

Love it how the guest Amanda Holden talking with the host Jamila Souffrant are having a good time and empowering folks by making this analogy between stock market investing and dating!

Journey To Launch Podcast episode 280
"Saving $30k To Quit Corporate America & Pivot To Teaching Women How To Invest With Amanda Holden"

Also for more Amanda Holden she was also previously a guest on "Popcorn Finance" Chris Browning podcast:
"Should I Max Out My IRA Before Buying Individual Stocks?"

In conclusion, think of the stock market growth average percentage like dating guys, a rule of thumb can be 10 of each per year!

PSA re-blogging about "The White-space Day". Because this came up again and again. Now. Years later. And it’s very empowering. So it has staying power so I want to resurface it on my latest blog again.

In short, the persona in the blog post is distracted, is walking the dog but not enjoying it as usual.

They realize it and call this 'the overwhelm'. And, and thereupon, the persona the writer says they have a cure for this, that is 'a complete white-space day'.

That's where they take a day to mostly rest and relax and maybe tidy up and declutter including what they in a linked blog post call "To-do list zero", and then go walk the dog again and now enjoy it.

Morgan: This blog post is excellent. Thank you to the author for having put to words how to recognize this and how to know what needs to be done. It has helped me.

In conclusion this is one excellent post, and way, to recognize when one is overwhelmed and what to do about it as well.

I want folks, like kids, to retire first, then go to college.

If they want to.

no, seriously.

Envision that each kid has ₷¤14,700 silver-bams in an investment that flows 5% per year.

So that flows ₷¤735 per year.

So that’s it, end of story.

Ok more details of the story:

So say the kid is savvy enough to not touch that ₷¤14,700 principal.

And so now they are flowing themselves 735 silver-bams per year.

And so they can if they live frugally they can just retire. Before they ever worked a day necessarily.

If they want to.

But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Because now the kid is retired.
And so they can now in their early early retirement, they can pursue anything they want for example they can go to college first thing.
And then after they go to college, they can get a job and work for money.

In other words if I'm savvy enough, even if I'm a kid, I can still have a normal life, and yet be retired at the same time.

Obviously this would be the smart way to do things if a kid can swing it.

And only if the kid wants to.

But I know life gets in the way and life happens. So maybe it won’t work for everyone.

Plus the kid has to surf frugality ongoing to make this happen. And that’s not for everyone.

But it’s one way to do it!

The book says save one tenth of my income.

‘The richest man in Babylon ‘ audiobook 
Chapter 3 — cure #1 for a lean purse
The character says to save 1/10 of the gold that enters thy purse. 

It says do spend, but only spend, 9/10 ongoing. And don't feel bad about spending the 9/10 because I already first saved 1/10 for a better life.

Morgan: I heard this same book is famous for 'pay yourself first' idea.
And here it is.
But moreupon, it says how much percentage to save. 

So in short, the idea is to, each time I get money coming in from income, first, before paying any bills, it's recommended to first set aside 1/10 of that into savings.
The book goes on to say also set aside 2/10 towards re-paying any loans/debt, if I have any loans.
It also goes on to say that 1/10 should best be invested in some project that will return additional profit back to me as well.

Morgan: Hmm that is interesting.

In conclusion, save one tenth.

<h2 id="2022-10-14_1157-worker-salaries"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-14_1157-worker-salaries">Worker Salaries are Cost of Goods Sold Whereas Corporate Salaries are Operating Expenses</a></h2>

If I understand, workers/laborers salaries under standard accounting paradigm are part of 'cost of goods sold' whereas corporate / executive / manager salaries under this standard paradigm are part of 'operating expenses'.

OK I learned this fact from from the motley fool money podcast episode from April 2nd 2022. It’s so mind blowing of a dichotomy that it deserves its own blog post.:

Guide to Financial Statements (1 of 2) Apr 02, 2022 (19:16) 
<a href="https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/2022-04-02-guide-to-financial-statements-1-of">https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/2022-04-02-guide-to-financial-statements-1-of</a>

—-the “cost of goods sold “ on the income statement .  workers salaries are part of the cost of goods sold.

—-the “operating expenses.” on the income statement . the salaries at headquarters (if i understand etc. the CEO’s salary is part of _operating expenses_ on the income statement. NOT part of Cost of goods sold)

…so basically the wage laborers and the workers are part of the product? 
…whereas the executives are part of the __(operation?)____ ?

LOL. workers are nouns. pawns. static. 
whereas executives and management are verbs. people who get things done. 
amazing. so telling. I can keep this in mind when looking for my next company. and when looking for my next job role.

Anyways its good to learn this fact.

Because I like to learn how the world really works.

Need to know how the world really works, then I can proceed to apply my own decisions and make informed decisions and steer my life accordingly.

In conclusion, I learned today that in a standard corporate paradigm worker wages are cost of goods sold on the accounting sheet whereas corporate employee salaries are part of operating expenses.

<h2 id="2022-10-14_1133-pe-ratio"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-14_1133-pe-ratio">Two Notes on P/E Ratio</a></h2>

Two notes on P/E Ratio.

First.

In this podcast episode, the guest Brian Feroldi, just after the 27 minute mark, says that sometime after 2005 he had passed on Salesforce Inc (CRM) because he had seen its valuation (P/E Ratio) was about 140, however now he regrets it because since then the company's stock price increased 33 times. ( a 33-bagger).

Rule Breaker Investing podcast —- (2021-09-22) “Market Cap Game Show…” 
<a href="https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2021-09-22-the-market-cap-game-show-brian-vs">https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2021-09-22-the-market-cap-game-show-brian-vs</a>

In other words, in this first example stood out because it was an example of one time when a high P/E ratio turned out to still be a good buy. (in hindsight only).

However this may be an exception. It's understood that most folks most times, do (and rightly do) avoid buying a stock whose P/E Ratio valuation is too high.

So food for thought.

Second.

Second note to think about regarding P/E ratio.

2021-04-07 rich dad radio podcast episode. At about the 20-minute mark.
They talk about how Japan's equities bubble in the 1990's.
Stocks were trading at 100x p/e ratio in this bubble in the 90s, they say.
The P/E ratio of more than one company stock, at the time in this country, was just one indicator of a wider economic problem at the time.

"The Feds are Creating a Liquidity Tsunami - Rich Dad Radio Show"
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000516094459">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000516094459</a>

And so in this second example, it is congruent with the first. They are saying that if the P/E Ratios for stocks are too high, then it's a bad sign, it's a sign of a concern and generally in these cases one should be careful.

In conclusion this has been a note about P/E ratios, for better or for worse. We learned something about P/E ratios. Namely P/E ratio is one way to value a company, and also namely that if P/E Ratios get too high then it may be a concern. For one example by the time one company's P/E Ratio got to 140 then one person judged that was already much too high for their tastes. This we have learned from this blog post.

Paradigm with humility how to view life:

Each moment going through time, I should view life as if the default state is me standing by myself alone outside in wilderness. And so keep that in mind that is the default human condition.

In this paradigm I always need to be proactive to do things like the following:
1.) Seek out family and friends and help them and share with them ongoing proactively. These relationships need to be found and maintained.
2.) Proactively ongoing work towards getting and maintaining compfortable shelter and clothing and food. These things need to be retained and maintained.
3.) If I want other more specific stuff like stock share of a company, or a hot cup of starbucks coffee in my hand, or a car full of gas parked in the lot to use on demand, etc, etc, then I also need to be proactive to get, and maintain, those as well. As these don't come by default.

That's it really, just that I need to remember these things don't come by default; I'm not entitled to any of these as an earthling. 

I need to get and maintain these, if I don't want to be alone in the wilderness standing or huddling under a bridge somewhere.

Default state ISN'T that I'm comfy in my house with a hot starbucks coffee that I just drove car full of gas to get, and family and friends who love me with me, and we're sitting on the couch watching a funny show and we have ₷¤5,882 silver bams in the bank and we have 10,000 shares of stock of my faviorite companies and my job is going well and my colleagues automaticalloy reach out and help me when they see I'm not up to par at work. 

The default state ISN'T that one of abundance sitting on the couch with a great situation by default. 
All those things need work to get and maintain. 
And ultimately I need to be the one to go and get them and maintain them. 
I can get help from others too, but, I need to do my share which isn't trivial share of the work, and I need to be proactive to help myself and also proactive to help others.

In conclusion I need to more use the humility paradigm and stay proactive like "who moved my cheese"*. Not reactive and entitled like the other failed character(s) from "who moved my cheese".



* Who Moved My Cheese <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Who-Moved-My-Cheese-Mazing/dp/0091816971">https://www.amazon.com/Who-Moved-My-Cheese-Mazing/dp/0091816971</a>

One way how to invest.

16 Bullet-points.

Note that these are mostly taken from fool.com Motley Fool ecosystem.

However they were never all 16x of them mentioned all in 1x Motley Fool essay or podcast-episode to my knowledge. 

And so it is really a summary of multiple Motley Fool philosophies, all mashed up into one summary/compilation here by me. 

Furthermore at least two of these are my (Morgan's) own suggestions not a Motley Fool suggestion per se. And so it really is a new list that is most/part Motley Fool philosopies but part Morgan philosophies too.

Without further ado:

1 • Buy a stock with 10% of each paycheck.

2 • Mom, dad, kids -- each takes a turn buying a stock.

3 • Each person holds GKC [Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum] number of stocks. (same number as their age)

4 • Choose a company where you personally had a great consumer experience.

5 • Choose a company that yields a dividend.

6 • Choose a company that's the only one doing what they're doing (niche).

7 • Choose a company thats stock price has been rising steadily recently.

8 • Choose a company that has a healthy balance sheet including its cash and debt.

9 • Choose a company that he P/E ratio *and true earnings growth potential* align and is high (between ~12 and ~78.)

10 • Choose a company that solves a real world problem.

11 • Choose a company that values win-win-win for all stakeholders.

12 • Choose a company with a long-term orientation.

13 • Choose a company that moreso evolves ongoing.

14 • Choose a company that cultivates good management.

15 • Choose a company that cultivates a great brand.

16 • Choose a company where people are habitually seeing it as overvalued.


In conclusion, this is one way how to invest in October 2022, in 16 bullet-points numbered list.

Yes this. 

Excellent, nice.

The guest says think of the stock market like dating guys; the stock market goes up on average 10% per year, and that is like for example she dates on average 10 guys per year, maybe some years maybe 0 guys, maybe 20 guys, but on average maybe 10 guys per year.

Love it how the guest Amanda Holden talking with the host Jamila Souffrant are having a good time and empowering folks by making this analogy between stock market investing and dating!

Journey To Launch Podcast episode 280
"Saving $30k To Quit Corporate America & Pivot To Teaching Women How To Invest With Amanda Holden"
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/journey-to-launch/id1257126028?i=1000571318435">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/journey-to-launch/id1257126028?i=1000571318435</a>

Also for more Amanda Holden she was also previously a guest on "Popcorn Finance" Chris Browning podcast:
"Should I Max Out My IRA Before Buying Individual Stocks?"
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/popcorn-finance/id1254075020?i=1000555443643">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/popcorn-finance/id1254075020?i=1000555443643</a>

In conclusion, think of the stock market growth average percentage like dating guys, a rule of thumb can be 10 of each per year!

PSA re-blogging about "The White-space Day". Because this came up again and again. Now. Years later. And it’s very empowering. So it has staying power so I want to resurface it on my latest blog again.

In short, the persona in the blog post is distracted, is walking the dog but not enjoying it as usual.

They realize it and call this 'the overwhelm'. And, and thereupon, the persona the writer says they have a cure for this, that is 'a complete white-space day'.

That's where they take a day to mostly rest and relax and maybe tidy up and declutter including what they in a linked blog post call "To-do list zero", and then go walk the dog again and now enjoy it.

Morgan: This blog post is excellent. Thank you to the author for having put to words how to recognize this and how to know what needs to be done. It has helped me.

In conclusion this is one excellent post, and way, to recognize when one is overwhelmed and what to do about it as well.

I want folks, like kids, to retire first, then go to college.

If they want to.

no, seriously.

Envision that each kid has ₷¤14,700 silver-bams in an investment that flows 5% per year.

So that flows ₷¤735 per year.

So that’s it, end of story.

Ok more details of the story:

So say the kid is savvy enough to not touch that ₷¤14,700 principal.

And so now they are flowing themselves 735 silver-bams per year.

And so they can if they live frugally they can just retire. Before they ever worked a day necessarily.

If they want to.

But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Because now the kid is retired.
And so they can now in their early early retirement, they can pursue anything they want for example they can go to college first thing.
And then after they go to college, they can get a job and work for money.

In other words if I'm savvy enough, even if I'm a kid, I can still have a normal life, and yet be retired at the same time.

Obviously this would be the smart way to do things if a kid can swing it.

And only if the kid wants to.

But I know life gets in the way and life happens. So maybe it won’t work for everyone.

Plus the kid has to surf frugality ongoing to make this happen. And that’s not for everyone.

But it’s one way to do it!

The book says save one tenth of my income.

‘The richest man in Babylon ‘ audiobook 
Chapter 3 — cure #1 for a lean purse
The character says to save 1/10 of the gold that enters thy purse. 

It says do spend, but only spend, 9/10 ongoing. And don't feel bad about spending the 9/10 because I already first saved 1/10 for a better life.

Morgan: I heard this same book is famous for 'pay yourself first' idea.
And here it is.
But moreupon, it says how much percentage to save. 

So in short, the idea is to, each time I get money coming in from income, first, before paying any bills, it's recommended to first set aside 1/10 of that into savings.
The book goes on to say also set aside 2/10 towards re-paying any loans/debt, if I have any loans.
It also goes on to say that 1/10 should best be invested in some project that will return additional profit back to me as well.

Morgan: Hmm that is interesting.

In conclusion, save one tenth.

<h2 id="2022-10-14_1157-worker-salaries"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-14_1157-worker-salaries">Worker Salaries are Cost of Goods Sold Whereas Corporate Salaries are Operating Expenses</a></h2>

If I understand, workers/laborers salaries under standard accounting paradigm are part of 'cost of goods sold' whereas corporate / executive / manager salaries under this standard paradigm are part of 'operating expenses'.

OK I learned this fact from from the motley fool money podcast episode from April 2nd 2022. It’s so mind blowing of a dichotomy that it deserves its own blog post.:

Guide to Financial Statements (1 of 2) Apr 02, 2022 (19:16) 
<a href="https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/2022-04-02-guide-to-financial-statements-1-of">https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/2022-04-02-guide-to-financial-statements-1-of</a>

—-the “cost of goods sold “ on the income statement .  workers salaries are part of the cost of goods sold.

—-the “operating expenses.” on the income statement . the salaries at headquarters (if i understand etc. the CEO’s salary is part of _operating expenses_ on the income statement. NOT part of Cost of goods sold)

…so basically the wage laborers and the workers are part of the product? 
…whereas the executives are part of the __(operation?)____ ?

LOL. workers are nouns. pawns. static. 
whereas executives and management are verbs. people who get things done. 
amazing. so telling. I can keep this in mind when looking for my next company. and when looking for my next job role.

Anyways its good to learn this fact.

Because I like to learn how the world really works.

Need to know how the world really works, then I can proceed to apply my own decisions and make informed decisions and steer my life accordingly.

In conclusion, I learned today that in a standard corporate paradigm worker wages are cost of goods sold on the accounting sheet whereas corporate employee salaries are part of operating expenses.

<h2 id="2022-10-14_1133-pe-ratio"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-14_1133-pe-ratio">Two Notes on P/E Ratio</a></h2>

Two notes on P/E Ratio.

First.

In this podcast episode, the guest Brian Feroldi, just after the 27 minute mark, says that sometime after 2005 he had passed on Salesforce Inc (CRM) because he had seen its valuation (P/E Ratio) was about 140, however now he regrets it because since then the company's stock price increased 33 times. ( a 33-bagger).

Rule Breaker Investing podcast —- (2021-09-22) “Market Cap Game Show…” 
<a href="https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2021-09-22-the-market-cap-game-show-brian-vs">https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2021-09-22-the-market-cap-game-show-brian-vs</a>

In other words, in this first example stood out because it was an example of one time when a high P/E ratio turned out to still be a good buy. (in hindsight only).

However this may be an exception. It's understood that most folks most times, do (and rightly do) avoid buying a stock whose P/E Ratio valuation is too high.

So food for thought.

Second.

Second note to think about regarding P/E ratio.

2021-04-07 rich dad radio podcast episode. At about the 20-minute mark.
They talk about how Japan's equities bubble in the 1990's.
Stocks were trading at 100x p/e ratio in this bubble in the 90s, they say.
The P/E ratio of more than one company stock, at the time in this country, was just one indicator of a wider economic problem at the time.

"The Feds are Creating a Liquidity Tsunami - Rich Dad Radio Show"
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000516094459">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000516094459</a>

And so in this second example, it is congruent with the first. They are saying that if the P/E Ratios for stocks are too high, then it's a bad sign, it's a sign of a concern and generally in these cases one should be careful.

In conclusion this has been a note about P/E ratios, for better or for worse. We learned something about P/E ratios. Namely P/E ratio is one way to value a company, and also namely that if P/E Ratios get too high then it may be a concern. For one example by the time one company's P/E Ratio got to 140 then one person judged that was already much too high for their tastes. This we have learned from this blog post.

<h2 id="2022-10-13_2114"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-13_2114">Paradigm With Humility How To View Life</a></h2>

Paradigm with humility how to view life:

Each moment going through time, I should view life as if the default state is me standing by myself alone outside in wilderness. And so keep that in mind that is the default human condition.

In this paradigm I always need to be proactive to do things like the following:
1.) Seek out family and friends and help them and share with them ongoing proactively. These relationships need to be found and maintained.
2.) Proactively ongoing work towards getting and maintaining compfortable shelter and clothing and food. These things need to be retained and maintained.
3.) If I want other more specific stuff like stock share of a company, or a hot cup of starbucks coffee in my hand, or a car full of gas parked in the lot to use on demand, etc, etc, then I also need to be proactive to get, and maintain, those as well. As these don't come by default.

That's it really, just that I need to remember these things don't come by default; I'm not entitled to any of these as an earthling. 

I need to get and maintain these, if I don't want to be alone in the wilderness standing or huddling under a bridge somewhere.

Default state ISN'T that I'm comfy in my house with a hot starbucks coffee that I just drove car full of gas to get, and family and friends who love me with me, and we're sitting on the couch watching a funny show and we have ₷¤5,882 silver bams in the bank and we have 10,000 shares of stock of my faviorite companies and my job is going well and my colleagues automaticalloy reach out and help me when they see I'm not up to par at work. 

The default state ISN'T that one of abundance sitting on the couch with a great situation by default. 
All those things need work to get and maintain. 
And ultimately I need to be the one to go and get them and maintain them. 
I can get help from others too, but, I need to do my share which isn't trivial share of the work, and I need to be proactive to help myself and also proactive to help others.

In conclusion I need to more use the humility paradigm and stay proactive like "who moved my cheese"*. Not reactive and entitled like the other failed character(s) from "who moved my cheese".

<h2 id="2022-10-13_2107"><a href="./2022-q4-blog.html#2022-10-13_2107">October 2022 - One Way How To Invest</a></h2>\

One way how to invest.

16 Bullet-points.

Note that these are mostly taken from fool.com Motley Fool ecosystem.

However they were never all 16x of them mentioned all in 1x Motley Fool essay or podcast-episode to my knowledge. 

And so it is really a summary of multiple Motley Fool philosophies, all mashed up into one summary/compilation here by me. 

Furthermore at least two of these are my (Morgan's) own suggestions not a Motley Fool suggestion per se. And so it really is a new list that is most/part Motley Fool philosopies but part Morgan philosophies too.

Without further ado:

1 • Buy a stock with 10% of each paycheck.

2 • Mom, dad, kids -- each takes a turn buying a stock.

3 • Each person holds GKC [Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum] number of stocks. (same number as their age)

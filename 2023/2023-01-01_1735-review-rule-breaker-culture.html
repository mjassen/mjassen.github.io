<h2>Review: Rule Breaker Investing Podcast Episode “Company Culture Tips, Vol. 10: Greatest Hits”</h2>
<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/19/company-culture-tips-vol-10-greatest-hits/">https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/11/19/company-culture-tips-vol-10-greatest-hits/</a>

In this podcast episode, they discuss tips how to make an excellent company culture, in a top 10 format.

Here are some of my favorite tips from this episode.

In number #10 they say it's good for a company to do a “dreamy check-in”, that is a couple times a year a company sponsored coach asks each employee how they’re doing and what help they could need.

This sounds excellent, what a great environment.

In number #2 they say to make workplace HR initiatives “compelling, not mandatory“ this means HR and management and leadership should make efforts to truly incentivize employees to themselves want to support company policies. As opposed to just somehow coercing employees to follow company policies.

In #1 “caring matters” They say that it's important for companies including HR and leadership and management to foster an environment, where each employee feels someone cares about them.

These were my top 3 favorite but if you listen to the podcast episode yourself you may have your own ones you like.

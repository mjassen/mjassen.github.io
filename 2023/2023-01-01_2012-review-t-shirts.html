<h2>Product Review: T-Shirts</h2>
I’m liking these t-shirts.

<a href="https://www.target.com/p/fruit-of-the-loom-men-s-12pk-crew-neck-short-sleeve-t-shirt-white/-/A-82074538">Fruit of the Loom Men's 12pk Crew Neck Short Sleeve T-Shirt - White</a>

These are good everyday wearing t-shirts.

A 12 pack may last for a year or more depending how often you wear these.

White t-shirts are good for being able to bleach them. 

In case you need to bleach your shirts to keep them fresh.

Fruit of the Loom if I recall is known as one of Warren Buffet's companies, via Berkshire Hathaway parent company.

However as for color shirts for men and women.

I found some at Walmart that I had been liking for a good value. For those times when you want not just a plain white t-shirt.

And then for colored shirts I've got these on my radar from Michael's too:

In conclusion, these are some of my favorites for plain white t-shirts and colored t-shirts.

<h2>Review: Podcast FranklinCovey On Leadership with Scott Miller Episode #230 Lisa Bilyeu</h2>
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/franklincovey-on-leadership-with-scott-miller/id1391164389?i=1000583804268">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/franklincovey-on-leadership-with-scott-miller/id1391164389?i=1000583804268</a>

At about the 17m. Mark the guest Lisa Bilyeu says, if you take on the identity of ‘the learner’ then your ego won’t be hurt by failure and you will learn and grow.

Bitsy Card note: This ESPECIALLY resonates with me PERSONALLY TODAY because I am ramping up a project today that involves soliciting folks for a noble and valuable project of mine.

So I know some rejection is just ahead.

And asking others for help with a project is the same thing that they're talking about really. 

The idea of both is to Always. Be. Networking. And. Always. Be. Learning. 

And, don’t take it personally for failure and for rejection. 

In fact this is a theme recently, in the recent on leadership ep. With “Don Miguel Ruiz” he said don’t take it personally too:

And now Lisa Bilyeu says so too in this episode.

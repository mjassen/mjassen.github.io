<h2>Review: Podcast Shares Sobering Macronomics Regarding Derivatives Vs Hard Assets</h2>

<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000587223297">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000587223297</a>

It's not new for Rich Dad Radio show podcast these days to state sobering facts regarding macroeconomics.

However this episode, they do it again, and it's again sobering.

Before the 10m. Mark, Guest Bert Dohmen says something like: '...we have 177 trillion dollars of derivatives in the United States, of which, the 4x biggest banks own 90%…'

Side note here is that, before the 11m. mark Kiyosaki comments on the ethnicity/race of the persona of his "rich dad". This I found to be interesting and rare, I only heard him reveal this twice now on the podcast. My opinion on this is I don't think this matters in any concrete way for anyone nor for Kiyosaki per se, except that I'm guessing that this may matter for emotional/personal reasons for Kiyosaki. However this is just speculation on my part.

Moving on.

In this episode the guest Bert says his newsletter’s motto is “timing is everything “

Bitsy Card note: Bert’s a self-proclaimed market timer. Macro timer understood, but still a timer. And so I'm going to take what he says with a grain of salt. Because in my opinion timing the market usually comes with great risk.

I love the quote they end of this episode with, like:
‘what your hand does, the mind remembers‘

Kiyosaki says this quote attributed to the persona of "Montessori", in the last 2 minutes of the podcast, meaning we should learn by doing and invest in hard assets and get skin in the game. 
Understood especially in contrast to the huge bubble of derivatives that exists out there today.

Thanks to the host and guests I enjoyed this podcast episode.

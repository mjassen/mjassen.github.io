<h2>Review: Besides All Else You Also Need Sales And Sales In Many Ways Equals Success</h2>

Note to self. Go back and listen to this podcast episode again later!

Rich Dad Radio Show podcast episode:
"Real Freedom is Financial Independence" 
with Robert Kiyosaki and his guest, Patrick Bet-David
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000588077520">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rich-dad-radio-show-in-your-face-advice-on-investing/id833641766?i=1000588077520</a>

The guest Patrick in the first 5-7 minutes nails it. 

Tells a story about the podcast guest Patrick selling Bally gym memberships at the shopping mall back in the day.

“It’s like the skillset of freedom”

The guest the persona of Patrick says, if someone else got the hot girlfriend even though you are a great person, it’s likely because they were better at sales.

The same for if someone else got the promotion at work even though you were more qualified,

And the same for if someone else in your family got their idea accepted to steer your family’s plans forward into the future, even though your idea would’ve been better for your family.

In short, they are saying how important sales skills are for succeeding in life.  

And throughout the episode they are saying some of the skills we mean when we say 'sales skills', may include:
• communication
• positivity
• getting a fair share for yourself
• reading people
• intuition
• Negotiation
• Thinking of creative alternatives
• charismatic
• Seeing failing as moving towards success
• confidence

There are really a lot of gems in this podcast episode, I do recommend if you are interested in this stuff for you to listen to this podcast episode, the link is at the beginning of this blog post!

—-they are saying that EVEN IN ORDER TO PROTECT ONE'S FREEDOMS in life/government/politics, ___I NEED TO SELL___ .
—-they say selling is different than “working hard” 
—-they say selling is DIFFERENT even than “COURAGE” 
—-they say selling is DIFFERENT even than EXTREME HIGH SKILLS [genius software coder, or talented surgeon, etc. etc.]
—-they are repeat saying “sales equals income” 

So if you want money to afford buying things, you first need to sell to generate income first.

They are saying scholars and PHDs think their education and PHD entitles them to a high income, but in reality it doesn’t; schooling and education and scholarship doesn’t entitle anyone to bypass capitalism. Nor even does COURAGE ALONE. Sales is needed TOO IN ADDITION.

At about the ~28m. Mark the guest Patrick says like:
‘there are greedy rich people and there are greedy poor people’.
‘There are hardworking poor people and there are lazy poor people.’

Bitsy Card note: Right. It's not a dichotomy, there are all sorts! It's not 1 and 0, it's not black and white.

Bitsy Card note: This reminds me of this other previous episode where they were also harping on how important sales skills are:

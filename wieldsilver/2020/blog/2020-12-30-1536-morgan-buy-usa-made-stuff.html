<h2>Idea to Buy USA Made Stuff</h2>

I got this idea in my head I want to buy USA made stuff.

So I take shoes for an example.

I research around and see a couple of USA made shoes and companies.

Looking at the price tags of the ones I see, they look like 162-216 silver-grams is the normal to low end price range.

How does my idea sound now?

When I have recently actually been buying shoes for ~16 - 32 silver-grams per pair, and they have been made in China.

It sounds cool to think that USA companies can make anything and everything, and I can support them.

And then I can invest in them too if they are good companies.

But still the price is such a huge factor.

That's all, for now...



Edit: 2021-01-30 Updated to replace dollars with silver-grams (for the rate near 2020-12-30).

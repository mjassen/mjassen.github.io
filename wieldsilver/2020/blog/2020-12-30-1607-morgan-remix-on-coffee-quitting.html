0.) This relies on you wanting to get a good night's sleep, and realizing that you can't get a good night's sleep if you drink coffee after 3pm daily. (and hardly can if before that either.)

1.) Don't drink coffee after 3pm 
2.) Keep no coffee in the house
3.) Don't go out of the house before 4pm. for anything.

That's it.

Oh, and as a rule of thumb, coffee stays in your system for 36 hours (up to 4 days for more complete flush). This is my belief. (based on informal research incorporating "half-life" paradigm)

<h2>Project Plan for 2020 Weeks 02 and 03 - Marketing and Selling my Work Projects</h2>

2020-01-05 by author Morgan Jassen on <a href="https://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶">w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶</a>

This is a plan for a two-week growth and learning project for weeks 02 & 03 of 2020.

In the "Rich Dad" book¹, it's stressed the importance of sales and marketing skills (銷售和巿場營銷技能). 

- In these two weeks I will learn about “Marketing and Selling Work my Projects”. In other words career development activities such as defining my work role and defining my work projects, and and figuring out how to better market and sell my work projects to my peers.

- After the two-week project, I'll blog a “Final report” describing what happened during the project, and what I learned. (This report will be based on daily journal entries that I kept during the two-week project.)

Arbitrary jam for this two week sprint: “戴佩妮 - 時間快轉” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%E6%88%B4%E4%BD%A9%E5%A6%AE+%E6%99%82%E9%96%93%E5%BF%AB%E8%BD%89">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%E6%8...%BD%89</a>

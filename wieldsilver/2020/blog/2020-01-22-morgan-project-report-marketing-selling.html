<h2>Final report for Project for weeks 02 & 03 (2020) - Marketing and Selling my Work Projects</h2>

2020-01-22 by author Morgan Jassen on <a href="https://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶">w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶</a>

Did and learned:

- Learned that in order to market + sell my own work project, I need to first learn about my colleagues' projects. Indeed, it is imperative that I first learn/know what my colleagues are working on in order to be able to align my projects with theirs. In other words, I shouldn't even hardly try to market or sell my roles/projects to people who aren't also working on (i.e. interested in) the same roles/projects as me!

- Learned that in order to market + sell my own roles & projects, I need to first fully understand, or define, my own roles & projects. For example I need to at least write and have written, one clear and concise paragraph describing what my current role and project is. Once I have this written and ready, then I will be better ready to market and sell this to my colleagues.

Ok, so then why is this relevant to the mission of w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶?

Why is this relevant to journey-to-Financial-Independence and using interest to pay for vacations?

It's relevant because investors flow interest money (dividends) to themselves by buying & owning companies, which make money by marketing, selling, and completing successful projects.

Thus in order to be successful at buying companies and flowing interest money to ourselves, we should be learning how companies market, sell, and complete successful projects.

In conclusion, in this two week sprint, I learned ^these things.

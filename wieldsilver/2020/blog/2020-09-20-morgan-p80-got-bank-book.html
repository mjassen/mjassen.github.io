<h2>Review of Up to Page 80 in I Got Bank Book</h2>

After reading up to page 80 (end of chapter 33) in "I Got Bank".

This book "I Got Bank" ¹ by author Teri Williams gives me the chills, it is a touching story with many characters, with money lessons touching their lives in many different ways.

Friendship and community are intertwined in the story.

An impressive part is when Jazz and Marquis' peer on the bus thinks Jazz's brother owns the car wash based on that Jazz's brother drives a fancy car which is parked at the car wash. Emotions are high because of what is said at the time, but Jazz and his friend just chuckle between themselves later at what their peer on the bus had said. The lesson is that it's not always the person who drives the fanciest car who is the business owner.

An impressive drama in the story is when Jazz is conflicted between self-discipline and personal empowerment, and [or] [against] guilt, in chapters 30-32, about whether or not to donate money to his sister's charitable cause.

A very impressive part of the story line that develops across the book, all the way from chapter 6 or earlier, through the middle, and to the end of the book, are the small business ventures, including two car wash businesses (or three counting their rivals) that touch the lives (and finances) of multiple people (and multiple families) in the community.

I enjoy reading about the car wash businesses, including how the characters integrate the car wash into their lives, and the car wash integrates into the community. 

Now at the end of Chapter 33, with just two chapters to go, I make a note to myself to re-read this book again soon. Because I know these are timeless lessons that will keep teaching as I grow.

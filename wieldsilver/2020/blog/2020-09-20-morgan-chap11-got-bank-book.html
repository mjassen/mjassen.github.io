Review of After Chapter 11 of “I Got Bank!” Book

After chapter 11 (p. 44) of “I Got Bank!” ¹ book by author Teri Williams, concepts like: ...Where are the kids?..., and ...How does this place make money?... have been introduced.

~~~ 1.)
The book says that the former ...Where are the kids?... asks the question, in the bank how come there seem to never be any kids? 

Excellent question. Should there be more kids hanging out in the bank?

It comes to mind the "Young Money Masters"** youtube channel, where the kid goes to visit the Capital one Cafe with his mom. Nice.

“My First Visit to the Capital One Cafe” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YVD-JDSnDw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YVD-JDSnDw</a> ~~~

~~~ 2.)
The book says that the latter ...How does this place make money?... says that the main character Jazz's Granddad had taught him a thinking game.

A game whereby every time he goes into a retail store or similar commercial establishment, to consider the question of how the money flows through the organization and how the organization makes their profit. 

(For example the fees coming in combined with the business expenses paid. ~~~

I'm really loving this book! These were just two of the interesting nuggets leading up to the end of chapter 11.

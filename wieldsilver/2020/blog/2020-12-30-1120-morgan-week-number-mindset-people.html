Week Number Mindset People Continuum

There is in the world at large observed a paradigm of a week number mindset continuum.

Business and financial people moreso tend to use week numbers and plan by week/year.

I dare say so-called working class people moreso tend to live day-to-day and plan by day/week instead.

For example 2020-08-04 is in week 32 of 2020. But only the former "type" of people habitually tend to think this way.

In summary, there is a continuum of mindset more thinking by day/week and more thinking by week/year.

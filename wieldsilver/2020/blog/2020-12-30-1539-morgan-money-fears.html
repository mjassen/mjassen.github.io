<h2>Money Fears</h2>
<h2>對錢感到緊張不安</h2>

Money fears.

The phrase of the decade is money fears.

This is the phrase of the week this week too, and of this year.

On the path towards to financial independence, money fears are real and constant.

In fact, they are so real and so important that.., that... that... ....

I can spend, or the fears can eat, or I can let the fears eat, all of my effort towards financial independence, indefinitely, ongoing forever.

Money fears can be that huge.

Thus a challenge becomes, and remains, navigating money fears ongoing, along the path to financial independence.

How?

Start past the money fears? 

Use grit and determination to stay vigilant through money fears?

Talk through money fears with trusted friends and advisors?

Meditate on money fears and come to a peaceful coexistence with the fears?

Bravely face money fears head on?

All of the above, at the appropriate time?

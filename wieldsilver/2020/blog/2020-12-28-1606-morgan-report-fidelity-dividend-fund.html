* "...the Adviser relies on fundamental analysis..."

* “Value” stocks might be relatively inexpensive but might not realize their supposed value.

* 10y. lowest yearly return was -4.49% (2018), highest was 22.48% (2019)
* The fund may have other caveats so consider your own research and decision.
* Morgan's personal note: What I may call commoditizing stocks. I mean, this fund is already another layer of abstraction compared to stocks themselves which are abstract. Then after this, other brokers/advisers may also further re-bundle/re-sell the fund as well. It's amazing truly the layers.

In conclusion, ^this is a summary about this particular Dividend Fund and what I learned about this fund, while learning about this.

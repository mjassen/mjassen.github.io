<h2>One Actually Only Needs To Own One Company To Become Wealthy</h2>

One actually only needs to own one company to become wealthy. 

I think this should be remembered for its simplicity and because of a feeling of humility.

For example, executives and workers at a 400-person company all work full-time effort year after year to make a company profitable.

And yet a truly smart investor usually thinks that same company either isn't a good company, or even if that's a good company, that it's not good to invest more than 15% of one's portfolio in that one company.

But still. One actually only needs to own one company to become wealthy.

However. 

It does have to be the right company. 

In reality diversification may be smarter in most cases. 

However. 

In principle only one good company is needed.

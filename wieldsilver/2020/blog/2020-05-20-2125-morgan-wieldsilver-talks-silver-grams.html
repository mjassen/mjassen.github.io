<h2>w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ Talks in Silver-grams Quantities Instead of Dollars Quantities</h2>

2020-05-20 21:25 by author Morgan Jassen on <a href="https://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶">w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶</a>



w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ uses a paradigm of talking about the prices of expenses or assets *in terms of silver-grams unit of value-measurement*. 

This snaps earthlings out of the idea of "dollars", which especially elicits emotional attachment.

Thus by talking prices in grams of silver, the feeling is more objective, and thus good for objectively increasing financial IQ.

In order to make real world sense of silver-grams value-measurements one first converts dollars prices to silver-grams, and vice-versa. 

However in any case, if a reference point is listed alongside like a hamburger costs 10 silver-grams and 4 shares of Disney stock costs 1,695 silver-grams, then, that gives perspective of the value of one silver-gram.

In a sense, this treats US-dollars-money (USD$) as a taboo, yet still talks about money.

In a sense, this dissociates US-dollars-money-(USD$) "money fears" with investing. Nice.

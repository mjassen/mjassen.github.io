<h2>Why Do I Blog About Non-money Stuff on this Money blog?</h2>

2020-05-13 by author Morgan Jassen on <a href="https://w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶">w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶</a>

Why I keep blogging about stuff not directly related to money? I do. 

On a journey to financial independence, there are numerous IMPORTANT non-money challenges along the way. 

But these obstacles are so important that they are not problems, and they can't be ignored; rather they are factors that must be integrated into my journey.

Caring for family and friends, cooking, eating, and resting, working, disagreeing with stakeholders on money issues, blogging, and more. Challenges.

BUT. 

This is a blog about LONG TERM path to financial independence, money, and using money to pay for vacationing with friends. I will get through this and will get there. Faith.

Have I lost focus? No. I'm still focused, and using a long-term, life-integrated approach.

Not knowing where to start.
Facing multiple challenges at a time.
Facing challenges that feel unsurmountable.

Should I give up? Or look for a nonexistent shortcut or avoid or ignore these important and necessary life challenges?

NO, it's not needed to pass all of these obstacles at the same time, nor to try and skip past them real quick-like.

Instead, do work in two-week sprints to integrate the challenges into the journey. Iterate. Deal with each challenge or obstacle in turn, and go through each one — deal with each one in a quick and proper manner and then move on.

Believe that soon, more of the sprints can be more directly money-focused.

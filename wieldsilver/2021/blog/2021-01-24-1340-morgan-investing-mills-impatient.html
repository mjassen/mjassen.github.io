<h2>Investing in Mills for the Impatient</h2>

Investing for the impatient.

To make it more exciting sounding. 

Imagined user story as follows:

I buy 11 silver-grams† of IBM company, and then in tenths of pennies (a.k.a. “mills”), i earn one per day! Wow!

(One mill per day, is somewhere near 3-5% annual return on investment on 11 silver-grams principal amount)

But being able to say at least “1 per day” is more exciting than saying a half-dollar per year.

Beyond speaking in terms of mills, we could also/alternately speak in terms of silver-grams, silver-milligrams, or millionths-of-bitcoins. Etc.

In conclusion, it's more interesting to talk in terms of Mills per day than half-dollars per year.



2021-01-30 Edit: Updated dollars and cents to silver-grams and half-dollars.

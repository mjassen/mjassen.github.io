<h2>How to buy Marriot in June 2021?</h2>

~~~ Project Plan

- In this two week project sprint, I ask, "How can I afford 112 silver-grams† of Marriott company?"

- So my idea is I buy a company with my hard earned money, then the company pays for stuff. I also want everyone else to use this idea too, if they wish to themselves. 
For example in my vision I like Verizon (VZ) or Marriott (MAR) or Schwab (SCHW), so this fortnight I say I want to buy Marriott. 
But how? I got 83 other problems in my life besides.
How can I afford 112 silver-grams of Marriott company?

- During the sprint I'll write a journal note of what I did and learned.

- After the two-week project, I'll update the “Final report” section here below.

~~~ Final Report

I did and learned:

- Didn't buy any Marriott
- Next roadblock is to be more frugal ongoing
- Next roadblock is to get higher salary ongoing

- Found "Marriott Careers" youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MarriottJobs/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/MarriottJobs/featured</a>

In conclusion, feels like the same old blocks. Failed to buy Marriott. However small win by realizing just a bit more, just how hard it is to overcome roadblocks to buying stock. There are 83 other problems that are grabbing my attention and not sure how to focus down and re-prioritize to keep most important first and at same time invest for future. However right now decided the next little edges that are needed more financially are 1.) be more frugal ongoing and 2.) Salary increase. These are not what I expected. I expected to be able to buy 112 silver-grams of Marriott and that marriot would help pay for my other life expenses. However it's not so, not yet. Current mindset and atmosphere don't yet allow it. However need to either find out how to steer towards it or else to make a new plan.

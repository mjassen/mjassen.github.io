2020-11-25 Nashoba Note Remix Ideas

Here are some questions about how the Nashoba Note could work.

What if Nashoba Note connected local independent news authors with local business sponsors by allowing both to agree to post a sponsor ad on a blog post? 

Envisioning it still being about empowering the local economy people with a bias towards local projects that make an economic difference and keep dollars circulating in the local economy.

What about future scaling and supporting website traffic? How many people in 8x Nashoba towns -- 80,000?. What would it take for 10% (so 8,000?) regular readers? That would be busy/traffic.

In this paradigm how about a challenge of managing the sponsors and their ads, and then also the authors and their articles, and then also the one-to-many (or else one-to-one) relationships of the sponsor-ad to the author-article?

How about just make that one-to-one? Solved!?

How about just make a spreadsheet or a database table of all the 1.sponsors, 2.ads, 3.authors, 4.articles, and 5.ads-to-articles-links? Solved!?

"How does this place (I.e. the Nashoba Note) make money?"
... How about by getting a fixed percentage of each ad sale? Solved!?

How much does an ad cost? How about $100? How about $1000?

How much money does the author get (per article)? $80? How much money does the The Nashoba Note get (per article)? $20?

How does the Software work and scale? How about that it is a static html site broken up by year and has a main front page with a huge long list of links to this year's articles (a feed of all authors/articles links)? Solved!?

* And then what if the actual underlying structure is a directories first by year, then by Month then by day then by author, and a folder only appears if there is an article therein?

* And what about powering it by the moedit editor?

In conclusion these are some questions about how the Nashoba Note could work.

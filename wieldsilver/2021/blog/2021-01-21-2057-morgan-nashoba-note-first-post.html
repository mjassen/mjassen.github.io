First Post - Empowering Local People Making the Nashoba Area Economy Prosper

Why the NASHOBA NOTE? 
Empowering local people making the Nashoba area economy prosper.


How the NASHOBA NOTE?
MONEY ENVISIONED COMES FROM:
—- Swap meet revenue (sponsor-vendors and maybe a dollar per attendee)
—- paper “special editions”(sponsor-vendors and maybe a dollar per issue/edition)


Who the NASHOBA NOTE?
- people who want the local economy and themselves to navigate strength through depressions
- Workers at the NOTE in furture may become shareholders, 
- Envisioned in future as each quarter the org. arbitrarily grows by 250,000 "shares" and this is equally split between all active current contributing staff. This is really extreme so needs iterating before starting doing.


Highlights:

* Bias to local projects that are making an economic difference. 
* Bias to people who live local.
* Bias to people that are making an economic difference.
* Bias local projects where money is being exchanged.
* Bias towards projects that keep money circulating within the local community.
* Authors tend to be local.
* Bias for reporting depression-resistent projects and organizations.
* Bias to companies incorporated locally.
* Bias to local comanies with goods/products.
* Bias to company goods that are being exchanged/transported/repaired locally.
* Bias to companies with a local brick and mortar presence/office/space/building.

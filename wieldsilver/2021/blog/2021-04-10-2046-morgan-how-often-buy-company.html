How Often to Buy a Company?

The unanswered and unasked question was, "How often to invest? How often to buy stock?"

Then this podcast episode answered the question.

About 7m.40s. in to this Rule Breaker Investing podcast episode, host David Gardner says: "...I'm saving every two weeks, and I'm investing..."

What he is saying is that he adds money (buys stocks) every two weeks, and he goes on to hint that he thinks other folks may want to do the same with their work income too. 

I take this to mean that he buys stocks with every paycheck. 

And “pay yourself first”¹ comes to mind for me here. Though gardner doesn't use these exact words.

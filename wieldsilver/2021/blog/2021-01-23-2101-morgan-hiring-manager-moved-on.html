<h2>The Hiring Manager Has Moved On</h2>

There is a special wake-up call I've now had a couple of times.

1.) 
The set up:

The set up is that I applied for a job that I wanted, and didn't get chosen.

In a couple of cases I was a bit bitter, resentful of not having gotten that job.


2.)
The wake-up call:

The wake-up call is when I see that the hiring manager for that position has now moved on.

In other words, it's already been a couple years, and now the hiring manager that helped decide to not go with me as a candidate, has already themselves now since moved on.

The wake up call is that guess what, it's time for me to move on. 

The power of emotion in not being chosen. 

In conclusion, if the manager moved on by now, then it's sooo time for me to move on.

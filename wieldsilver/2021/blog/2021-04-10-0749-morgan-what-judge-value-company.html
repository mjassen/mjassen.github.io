<h2>Use What to Judge the Value of a Company?</h2>

The unspoken and unaswered question was, "what to use to judge the value of a company?"

Then I heard this podcast which answered the question.

"The Rich Dad Radio Show" [2021-04-07] <a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/richard-duncan-1">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/richard-duncan-1</a>

About 20 minutes in to the podcast episode, the guest talks about a stock market bubble in Japan's economy within the past few decades.
And he said one thing he saw was company stock prices were trading at 100 times their P/E ratio. 

P/E is price to earnings ratio. 
So what this means is that people paid a high price for a share of stock compared to the company's actual earnings.
So this tells me earnings are what can tell the value of a company.

At least that's one indicator of the value of a company.

In conclusion, a company's earnings, of "price to earnings" fame, can be used to judge the value of a company.

<h2>Buy a Company - Project for 2021 Week 21 & 22</h2>

~~~ Project Plan

- In this two week project sprint, I'll aim for buying a company.

- Why, is that I want the company to pay for everything. 

- So my idea is I buy a company, then the company pays for everything.
It's an old paradigm.
I also want everyone else to use this paradigm too, if they wish to themselves,
I envision it that everyone buys and owns shares of their favorite companies. Everyone also works hard in their jobs at these companies. And everyone also is customers of these companies.
In my vision everyone who wants to be, is owner, employee, and customer, of the company.
So back to this two weeks.
I want to buy part of one company these two weeks.
For example in my vision I may aim to buy Apple, or Chipotle, or Nike, themselves picked at random from my list of 12 current favorite companies, whichever by a role of dice or coin flip. For example by random, Chipotle.
For example I may buy 112 silver-grams† worth of this company, if I can pass roadblocks in order to do so.

- However I know for a fact from experience that I'll meet many roadblocks in the next two weeks that will appear as blocks to me buying this. I estimate that I may need to stop or pause to help others' noble projects, reduce my phone bill, cook dinner while learning chinese recipes, try to get a mortgage, make a date night, and try to get a higher salary, and read support tickets for work.
But I want to find a way to still buy this amount of this company even considering the blocks I will meet.

- Why is that I envision that If I buy a company then in turn that company may bear profits which will support me and those close to me.
Another block could be that the company that I buy may not produce a profit. And yet I still want to do this; to aim for this per my vision.

- During the sprint I'll write a daily journal note of what I did and learned.

- After the two-week project, I'll update the “Final report” section here below.

~~~ Final Report

I did and learned:

* I compiled some financial data about Chipotle company:

* I saw some Chipotle Team Member job descriptions:

* I didn't buy Chipotle company stock shares.

* I met a roadblock that I first need to work with personal financial stakeholders and figure out homeowner costs.
In other words homeowner costs issues and personal financial stakeholder issues are currently blocking me from buying any/the originally-planned amount of 112 silver-grams worth of Chipotle stock. 

In conclusion, I didn't buy stock this fortnight thus there's no new stock shares potentially flowing interest income to pay for everything else. I learned more the strength of money pulling towards buying home ownership which is perceived to prohibit buying company stock shares which prohibits buying company stock shares.

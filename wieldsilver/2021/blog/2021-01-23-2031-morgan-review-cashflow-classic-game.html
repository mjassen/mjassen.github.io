<h2>Review of “CASHFLOW® Classic” (FREE) Game Online</h2>


In 2020 was the second time I actually played the "CASHFLOW® Classic (FREE)" game online. 

(At <a href="https://www.richdad.com/products/cashflow-classic">https://www.richdad.com/products/cashflow-classic</a> (in 2020.))

My reactions:

* I'm glad the Rich Dad¹ book previously introduced the following to me: income statement, assets sheet, and more.

* I'm thankful I read the Rich Dad book previously because Lechter's persona in the book told how to play, how to win, and that it may be hard.

* I am glad the online game can be a 1-player game to start, and no time limit. Thus no rushed feeling nor competition emotion.

* I'm thankful I previously read an online review about someone doing solo playing. Thus solo playing seemed normal.

* The online CASHFLOW® Classic game shares concepts with a Youtube product review: "Cashflow for Kids Game | Teaching kids how to manage money" ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98krMlG-OxQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98krMlG-OxQ</a> on the "Young Money Masters" youtube channel (in 2019 or 2020)).

* Having previouslywatched ^this Youtube product review, set my expectaions and set me up for winning!

* I was glad to play any CASHFLOW game. Fortunate to play for free. (only needed to sign up for a free account first) 

* As I have been too frugal (i.e. cheap) to front the 75 or so silver-grams² price tag for the real Cash flow board game.

* This, my second time playing, I was able to "get out of the rat race" within about 30 minutes, after some few dozens of dice-rolls. 

* I noticed I was excided to need to grab a calculator! 

* While playing, I wanted to calculate the value of different assets, liabilities, and opportunities. 

* I wanted to calculate assets' positive and negative monthly cash flows and compare them to each other. 

* I wanted to accurately decide what were good deals and what were not good deals.


In summary, I liked the game, and even after a couple of games have already learned a lot from it. Later I will play more and learn more!

² Silver Spot XAG=X | USD $26.74 | <a href="https://www.reuters.com/quote/XAG=X">https://www.reuters.com/quote/XAG=X</a> | Therefore 2020-09-11 (SILVER 1 gram = USD $0.94)


Scratch calculations:

Silver Spot XAG=X | USD $26.74 | <a href="https://www.reuters.com/quote/XAG=X">https://www.reuters.com/quote/XAG=X</a>
1 ounce = 28.35 gram, therefore:
( $x / 1g. ) = ( $26.74 / 28.35g. )
Now: 2020-09-11 SILVER 1 gram = USD $0.94.
Previous: 2020-05-25 SILVER 1 gram = USD $0.54

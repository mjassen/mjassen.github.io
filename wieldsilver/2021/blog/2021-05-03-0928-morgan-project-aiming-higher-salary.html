<h2>Aiming for Getting Higher Salary Aiming for 45-67k Silver-grams† Including Passing Roadblocks on the Way - Project for 2021 Week 19 & 20</h2>

~~~ Project Plan

- In this two week project sprint, I'll aim for getting higher salary.
I'll aim towards 45-67k silver-grams per year. Including roadblocks on the way.

- What's this to do with w̶i̶e̶l̶d̶s̶i̶l̶v̶e̶r̶.̶c̶o̶m̶ goal of using interest to pay for vacations? 
I want to buy more stocks to flow more interest. My adviser says higher salary will empower this. Thus for two weeks now I'll work towards higher salary.

- This means acting professional.

— Reading more support tickets. To close the professional learning loop.

- Making a date night to improve personal life.

- Attending Nashua Tech Net networking meeting. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3242128/">https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3242128/</a>

- Also pausing during the two weeks to help others with their projects as needed.

- During the sprint I'll write a daily journal note of what I did and learned.

- After the two-week project, I'll update the “Final report” section here below.

~~~ Final Report

I did and learned:

Attended Nashua Tech Net May 13 2021 meeting. 
Got advice incuding that, with what I learn and what patterns I see, then I can sell myself into future professional positions/roles.

I read ~4h. of support tickets in order to close the learning loop.
I found some tickets were resolved by me, some resolved, some unresolved, some had become auto-closed, some had needed further action.
Messaged some of my colleagues to network after having seen their work on some tickets.

In conclusion, I became more professional. And while my salary's not yet higher than two weeks ago, I am now in a better position for that.

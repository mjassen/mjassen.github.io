Questions About Stocks and Companies and Stuff

About 4 months ago I wrote some notes and questions on meetup.com:
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Investing-Meetup-Group/events/pccvwrybcmbzb/">https://www.meetup.com/Investing-Meetup-Group/events/pccvwrybcmbzb/</a>

I asked about:

Companmies owning companies, and
The S&P 500 list, and
Class B stock vs. Class A stock, and
How the S&P 500 list of companies is curated, and
What does “Security Analysis” book mean when it says “bonds”, and 
Private companies during an economic bubble, and 
Morningstar data, and
The “S&P 400” and the “S&P 600”

In conclusion, I did that. I asked about those.

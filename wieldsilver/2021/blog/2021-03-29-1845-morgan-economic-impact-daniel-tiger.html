Economic Impact of Daniel Tiger

I am interested in how Daniel Tiger makes an economic difference.

I was interested in seeing Daniel Tiger got a ~2.24 million silver-gram† grant a couple years back from Rite Aid Foundation. 

I researched PBS looking for their income and expense statements and balance sheet.

It looked like they had yearly cash flows of some tens or hundreds of thousands of silver-grams, not in the millions.

I wanted to try and find out more about Daniel tiger. How does PBS manage Daniel Tiger and so many other media programs, on what I thought was seemingly low budget etc?

On Daniel Tiger wikipedia page it linked to, and led me to information about a private media production and distribution company called 9 Story Media Group Inc:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_Story_Media_Group

Then on their site https://9story.com/ i see they help in producing and distributing many kids media programs, for different organizations (PBS, Scholastic, etc.)

Interesting to learn just this little bit more about the seeming flow of money in the context of Daniel Tiger and in the context of PBS and of associated companies, in this cased in the context of 9 Story Media Group.

Ultimately I didn't see how the money specifically flows from/through Rite Aid Foundation, nor how it flows through/to PBS organization, nor if/how the money flows through 9 Story Media group.

Ok now I wondered about the production and distribution of other media series in the context of PBS kids, for examle "Elinor Wonders Why"
According to Wikipedia, production companies for Elinor Wonders Why are Pipeline Studios and Shoe Ink

Pipeline studios seems like a private company:

Thunderbird Entertainment Group Inc.Type	Public Traded as TSX-V: TBRD

Pinkalicious & Peterrific (tv series on PBS kids)

Sixteen South https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteen_South

In conclusion, looks like the "closest thing to" a public company that is producing/distributing for/with PBS (PBS kids) so far I found is:

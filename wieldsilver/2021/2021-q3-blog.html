<h2>Earthling Yearly Income $3000 Dollars Per Year ₷¤365 Silver Bams Per Year</h2>

According to this 2013 article (see below), an earthling in 2013 earned 3,000 dollars per year on average.

This is soooo rough and also the article is already ~8 years old now and I'm only using one source here.

But for my purposes, it's close enough to calculate a currency ratio for this blog.

With this I'll calculate what is a "Silver Bam" and what is its ratio.

One "Silver Bam" I shall say is 1/365th of an earthling's yearly income.

Income in this case meaning roughly worldwide median per-capita income.

I can update the current value of the "Silver Bam" periodically on this here blog post.

For the "Silver Bam" shorthand, I can use the two-symbol combination "₷¤".

Here is the quote followed by the source:
Quote:
"... worldwide... the median per-capita household income is $2,920 ..."
Source
"Worldwide, Median Household Income About $10,000"
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/166211/worldwide-median-household-income-000.aspx">https://news.gallup.com/poll/166211/worldwide-median-household-income-000.aspx</a>
The article also goes on to say like:
... United States ... $15,480 Median per-capita income..."
However the worldwide number is what I wanted to use. Rounded.

And so finally, how much is a Silver Bam currently worth?
For example the USD to Silver Bam exchange rate this year?

We'll say right now in 2021 one Silver Bam is worth ($3000 / 365) ~= $8

For example say a sack of rice costs USD$20 and I want to know how many Silver Bams that sack of rice costs.

One sack of rice in this example costs ($20 / 8) = ₷¤2.5 Silver bams

So the 2021 multiplier to convert USD to Silver Bams is (.125)

A $20 sack of rice, times the "silver bams multiplier" here (.125), tells us the sack of rice costs ₷¤2.5 Silver Bams.

A $2.30 cup of coffee, times (.125) equals ₷¤.29 Silver Bams. A cup of coffee costs ₷¤.29 Silver Bams

Wow, so your average earthling daily income (most likely from work income) earns ₷¤1 Silver Bam per day.

And then if said earthling wants to go out in Boston in 2021 and buy a sack of rice they need to spend ₷¤2.5 Silver Bams.

Or earthling wants to go out in Boston in 2021 and buy a coffee the earthling would to spend ₷¤.29 Silver Bams.

Or if earthling wants to buy 7 shares of stock at USD$139 per share (so $973), then that stock purchase will cost ₷¤122 Silver Bams.

In conclusion, I say an earthling's yearly income is ₷¤365 Silver Bams per year and in 2021 thats about $3000 dollars per year.

<h2>Navigating Piloting Surfing and the 道德經 Tao Te Ching</h2>

This mostly isn't a one-and-done world.

However folks constantly talk in terms of zero-sum games, quick fixes, silver bullets, easy solutions.

What's a word describes attaining-and-maintaining all in one?

To use to remind oneself to getting professional and staying professional.

To getting a spouse and keeping a spouse.

To getting a family and keeping a family.

To getting wealthy and staying wealthy.

Describing the product and the service all wrapped in to one, ongoing, not just one time.

Sometimes putting 'ing' on the end reminds that this is an ongoing endeavour.

Here are some:

navigating, piloting, surfing, steering, hustling, parlaying, engineering, jockeying, managing, handling, negotiating, striving

"道德" of 道德經 (Tao Te Ching) of 'Attaining and The Way' fame matches this.

In conclusion, earthlings mostly are navigating life ongoing.

<h2 id="2021-08-06_talk_about_money"><a href="https://wieldsilver.lemonmama.com/2021/2021-q3-blog.html#2021-08-06_talk_about_money">If We Talk About Money</a></h2>

A quote about talking about money stuck with me.

How I remembered the quote:
'If we talk more about money then we will have more money . If we talk less about money then we will have less money.'
Is how I remembered the quote.

It stuck with me and I kept remembering it because I've spent time in social circles where money is taboo.*

* "Money is Taboo" <a href="https://wieldsilver.lemonmama.com/2020/blog/2020-12-29-1611-morgan-money-is-taboo.html">https://wieldsilver.lemonmama.com/2020/blog/2020-12-29-1611-morgan-money-is-taboo.html</a>

And so I tend to agree.

And this isn't about good and evil, but rather about a spectrum. 
And the quote is pointing out that in order to be towards the end of the spectrum having more money, we're gonna have to talk about money to some extent.
And pointing out that if we talk less about money then its more likely we're going to end up nearer to the end of the spectrum having less money.

But another saying comes to mind; 'people are funny about money'. 
In other words money means completely different things to different people.
And people have emotional attachments, both positive and negative, to money.
And folks, myself included first, have fears and other emotions surrounding money.
So it's also true that tact and care must be taken ongoing to have money conversations.

So I looked up the quote; it was from Rich Dad Radio Show podcast episode:

"November 18, 2020 – Rich Dad Latino: How to Win in 2021 Robert and Kim Kiyosaki featuring Fernando Gonzalez"
<a href="https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/fernando-gonzalez">https://www.richdad.com/podcasts/fernando-gonzalez</a>

"...Fernando: ... we never talk about money, so we didn't have money. ..."

My thoughts above are not what they were talking about on the show before and after the quoted line per se, so in this blog post I am taking it out of context a bit and I've added my own thoughts. But the essence of that quote and the feeling surrounding that are there, the way it was presented on that part of the podcast episode, were very relatable. 

The way the podcast guest said that and the context they said it, sparked that feeling of being in a position where folks aren't talking about money and also don't have a lot of money and in hindsight the former seems to cause the latter. 
The podcast show episode and the podcast was talking about financial education.

In conclusion, for those who want to navigate money, we may have to start talking about money ongoing within reason and carefully.

<h2>I Have 84 Problems</h2>

I have 84 problems.

I'm fortunate. I know many people have 85 or 86 or more problems. 

But daily people tell me what they're worried about.

I see worries on the news.

And often these worries are in the number 84 spot on my list.

My list of 84 problems.

This is why it's hard to care so much when people tell me about their problem and I have 83 other higher-priority problems already.

But something else.

Sometimes if I take time to listen to the person.

It turns out that their underlying problem is the same as one of my top problems.

Like maintaining fairness or maintaining integrity. Dynamically are found on the top 10 of my list.

FIN.

<h2>Shares Outstanding Increasing Over the Years</h2>
<h2>流通在外股數年復一年在增加的一個例子</h2>

One example of a company's shares-outstanding increasing over the years. sample data size of 1. (CVS Health)

CVS
<a href="https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/financial-information/sec-filings/default.aspx">https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/financial-information/sec-filings/default.aspx</a>

LONG STORY SHORT, OVER 3 YEARS, CVS HEALTH CORP NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING SHARES HAS INCREASED from ( 102 / 102 ) to ( 132 / 102 ) in other words it increased 30% in 3 years or 10% per year.

These numbers are rough but illustrate a point that this company number of shares rises.

One takeaway is so I maybe should use market cap not stock price to judge value of a company. the real numbers from the 10-K's are below:

Common Stock, $0.01 par value, issued and outstanding at August 1, 2018:
1,018,063,785 shares

As of July 28, 2021, the registrant had 1,319,574,744 shares of common stock issued and outstanding

<h2>A Paradigm of Money， Self， Family， Friends， and People</h2>
<h2>一個模範關於錢，自己，家人，朋友，和人</h2>

Why people are funny about money with other people

Thinking of an interesting spectrum and phenomenon of why people are funny about money.

I frame it in terms of general importance.

I think for 90% of people in the world at large, they would say that the following people, "people more important than money", generally speaking:

- Myself
- my close family
- my intimate friends
- Maybe my close friends

But for the same people i posit that, generally only, they might tend to say compared to the folowing people, "money is more important":

- maybe my close friends
- my casual friends
- my acquaintences
- strangers
- enemies 

In other words I rather spend my time with my family and friends, then spend time tending to projects that produce income, then finally after that i would also be ready to help out acquaintences or strangers as well beyond that too.

One reason why money usually comes before acquaintences and before strangers, is, that for many of us there is a thin line between not-enough-money and plenty-of-money.
And that line moves too. For example for 90% folks, i get laid off and then boom suddenly i'm on the express path to not-enough-money until I get working again.

And money has an extremely close tie to my ability to care for myself and my family and my closest friends.

Interestingly though, for different people they may value money more in some ways or less in some ways, compared to these groups of people.

I read "Psychology of Money" book by Housel and it covers topics of money and people. Not these concepts here, but other interesting stuff about people and money for sure.

Prenuptual agreements regulate money between spouses (as does marriage itself).
And some people donate money to causes they like but that they aren't otherwise actively involved in, or give money to panhandlers.
The line can blur greatly and isn't a rigid 10/90% split, and, for some people it never was.

But i think this is very interesting.
In the past I had paid less attention to money so wouldn't even have thought of where to "draw a line" in terms of the general importance of money compared to the general importance of my time or the importance of people around me.

But now I started to, for better or worse.

If one starts paying more attention to money, one starts to more clearly see how it can flow between people.

Money flows to and from oneself.
To and from family.
Flows differently to and from different degrees of friends.
Flows differently to and from different degrees of acquantences, strangers, and enemies.

FIN.

<h2>My Reputation and What Folks Think of Me</h2>

It just hit me, epiphany, my new philosophy this minute will now become:

"I care more about my reputation than what people think of me."

I have started to care more about my reputation, than about what people think of me.

I know it sounds contradictory right. 

Yes im being playful with the words a bit.

But the point is...

In other words i used to try to be nice and to act so people would like me right away. In a word, in hindsight, i was trying to be charming.

However.

Now I find people really don't like me that much in general.

So i realized its time to focus more on long term.

Act in a way such that the person I'm talking with this minute, will like me 3 years later because of what I did/said this minute.

Even if they don't like what I'm doing/saying this minute.

It sounds obvious and even easy.

Like eating your vegetables instead of eating junk food, so your body will be healthy 3 years later.

But somehow I hadn't been doing it too well.

Paradigm shift time to navigate a strong character and build long-term relationships with people around me.

FIN.

<h2>I Hope 您 Get Rich</h2>
<h2>我希望You發財</h2>

I have a confession, that I secretly want to get rich. (Don't tell anyone!!!)

Some folks say, that ain't right.
Folks 看不起 people who wish themselves to be rich.

Thus the real conclusion is that, starting now, I don't want to get rich.
Instead I want you to get rich.

You're an earthling, I like you.

They say poor folks getting rich is OK.
Folks think 分享 riches with others is OK.

I hope you get rich.
Only if you want to yourself though.
I hope 您 get rich and that you share riches with folks.

Most folks think its ok to have generous rich friends.
As for myself, I hope I 交朋友 with generous rich people.

In conclusion, I hope you get rich, if you want to, because I like you.

<h2>“Review of Motely Fool Podcast episode - If You Want to Convince Someone to Invest Then First Take Care of Them As A Person Indefinitely”</h2>
<h2>“評論萬里富播客單集 - 如果要使確信配偶去投資股票的話最主要的是首先不斷的照顧那個人的本人”</h2>

In short this podcast episode answered the question how to convince someone to invest.

And the answer may be to take care of that someone as a person.

Rule Breaker Investing podcast, 2021-09-29 episode “September Mailbag: Different, But The Same”
<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/10/18/the-art-of-the-mailbag/">https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/10/18/the-art-of-the-mailbag/</a>

In this podcast episode 1h.16m. the mailbag writer asks the persona of David Gardner advice how to convince the writer's spouse to buy individual stocks baskets instead of mutual funds.

And in summary, Gardner is chill and says the writer is doing fine and the writer may want to continue to put the writer's spouse first and take care of the spouse as a person first as long as needed. Indefinitely in other words.

And to let the numbers for individual stocks baskets speak for themselves vs. Mutual funds.

My note is, well said.

For convincing a spouse of something, table stakes should be to first take care of the spouse as a person indefinitely.

Well put.

<h2>Calculating Financial Independence</h2>
<h2>計算財務自由</h2>

If we can get 5% on our investments.

Then to be finanically independent.

We'd just need to invest ₷¤41,176 <a href="https://wieldsilver.lemonmama.com/2022/2022-q1-blog.html#2022-01-01_2305_silver_bams">Silver Bams</a>.

Those ₷¤41,176 would flow interest yearly of ₷¤2,059.

And those ₷¤2,059 would cover our expenses.

Then we'd be financially independent.

Of course life happens before, during and after. 

Sometimes we work hard. Sometimes we rest.

But that is the money math part.

<h2>Balance Sheets Volume 1: Review of David Gardner on Twitter in 2015</h2>
<h2>資產負債表第一冊: 評論二零一五年大衛・加拿檢討Twitter公司的資產負債表</h2>

This blog post is "Balance Sheets Volume 1".

The idea is to learn about balance sheets and how to read them etc.

This example comes from a podcast episode.

In this 2016-May-25 Rule Breaker Investing podcast episode, from 12m.35s. until 14m.40s., the host the persona of David Gardner analyzes Twitter's 2015 balance sheet:
“May Mailbag: When to Add to Winners, Movie Villain Clichés, Short Selling, and More”
<a href="https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2016-05-25-may-mailbag-when-to-add-to-winners">https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2016-05-25-may-mailbag-when-to-add-to-winners</a>

Here are some points from the podcast along with my comments:

1.
- The persona of Gardner says Twitter has ₷¤64 million in sales in 2015. (₷¤ = Silver Bam, see previous blog posts)
--- My comment is I look myself and see twitter 2015 revenue was ₷¤65 million so that checks out.

2.
- He says that surpasses 3x their 2013 revenue.
--- My comment is I look myself and see twitter 2013 revenue was ₷¤19.7 million.

3.
- He says that is more gross profit in 2015 than sales in 2013
--- My comment is I look myself and see Twitter 2015 "gross margin %" was 67%. And I see the equation is ((Revenue) - (Total Costs) = (Gross Profit)) and Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of Revenue. Which means that twitter's 2015 gross profit was ₷¤43.8 million.
But then my comment is then see below; how is it they made ₷¤43.8 million gross profit and yet the company is still unprofitable? Oh well maybe I'll understand some day or if I analyze further. Moving on.

4.
- He says this represents a rapid growth situation.

5.
- He points out the company is unprofitable in 2015
--- My comment is which balance sheet number/field (or fields) represents the profitability of the company?

6.
- He says the company lost 13 million silver bams in 2015
--- My comment is I look myself and I see that twitter's 2015 "Operating Income" was -₷¤13 million. So that must be what he meant perhaps.

7.
- He says twitter spen ₷¤24 million in R&D in 2015
--- My comment is oops I look myself and can't find R&D on the balance sheet. Moving on.

8.
- He says twitter market cap in 2015 is about 290 million silver bams.
--- My comment is I look myself and I see that Twitter's 2015 Market cap is ₷¤471 million. Huh. I wonder why I saw it as 1.6 times what he saw it as.
My comment is I look myself and I see that Twitter has 660 million shares outstanding in 2015.

9.
- He says the company has more cash than debt in 2015
--- My comment is I look and see the following:
Twitter 2015 has ₷¤11 million of Operating Cash Flow
Twitter 2015 has ₷¤1.1 million of Free Cash Flow
Twitter 2015 has ₷¤44 million of Long-Term Debt.
My comment is huh what is the difference between Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow?
My question is then what does Gardner mean by cash and by debt? 
Moving on.

10.
- He says the company has 100 million d̶o̶l̶l̶a̶r̶s̶ silver bams in cash in 2015
--- My comment is I look myself what this may mean and I see the following so I presume it is one of the following:
I see Twitter has ₷¤115 million of Working Capital in 2015.
I see Twitter has ₷¤129 million of Total Equity in 2015.
Moving on.

11.
- He says Versus 44 million silver bams in debt in 2015
--- My comment is ok nice that matches the number mentioned above that I saw when I looked for Long-Term Debt.

12.
- Gardner says in closing that overall he approves of this balance sheet.

Finally, here are some past blog posts about the topic of Balance Sheets:

Summary of (April 2020) Peloton Analysis from Motley Fool

In conclusion, this blog post has been "Balance Sheets Volume 1", learning about balance sheets.

<h2>一次313年前的人被形容為赚8%的股利</h2>

—- the Anarchy (book) <a href="https://catalog.cwmars.org/eg/opac/record/4331254">https://catalog.cwmars.org/eg/opac/record/4331254</a>
—-page 64 describes that in 1708, East India Company had outstanding £3.2 million (worth of shares I presume) and that was owned by 3,000 shareholders and the shareholders received an 8 per cent dividend 
—- my comment: amazing . Aristocrats seems like but how different (or same) from today’s companies? And this was ~313 years ago now.
—-

In conclusion, the book described folks three centuries ago making an 8 percent dividend.

I (Morgan) love this comment in this podcast episode:
—- when asked how transactionally he buys a stock to enter a position he replies: ‘I place a market order’ 
(My comment: not a limit order) (???!!!)
He goes on: … buy in thirds … dollar cost averaging…

Next, Gardner comments on Kiyosaki Rich Dad ecosystem. I like to hear what he has to say because I am a big fan of both Gardner and Kiyosaki:

—-“CashFlow 101” board game by rich dad  kiyosaki reviewed — “[for gamers] it is not a very good board game”
——— re: fool reviewing rich dad stock advice: “stock advice so bad it will make you cringe”
——-in short, Gardner doesn’t say good stuff about rich dad stuff. However he does say Fool and Rich Dad do overlap in many areas and he knows Roch dad has helped a lot of people thing about money

My (Morgan's) comment: Nice save!
Critique of Kiyosaki at the same time a tip of the hat to him.

In conclusion, this episode I enjoyed seeing what Persona of David Gardner had to say onetime about persona of Robert Kiyosaki ecosystem.

<h2>EVENT: Cardano Blockchain Worcester - Live Meetup #3</h2>

This event upcoming looks interesting:

"Cardano Blockchain Worcester - Live Meetup #3"

Monday, January 24, 2022, 7:00 EST

Worcester, MA

<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Cardano-Blockchain-Worcester/events/282572510">https://www.meetup.com/Cardano-Blockchain-Worcester/events/282572510</a>



~~~
2022-02-01 Update:
Wow I'm learning more about Cardano a hard way. After I did these two:
1.) joined the Cardano Meetup group online and 
2.) blogged this blog post. 
Then just recently I was kicked out of another meetup group the reason was for Promoting the Cardano project.
And but the 1-2 above were the only things that I did that would approach promoting Cardano. I didn't post on the second meetup group about Cardano or anything like that.
This here blog post would be the strongest 'promotion of Cardano project' that I have ever done to date.
And on this blog I blog promoting many things, not just Cardano.
But in hindsight yes re-reading this it does turn out that I was promoting the Cardano project meetup and so in essence I was indeed promoting the Cardano project. 
This has opened my eyes I must say.
I must say the reason I was drawn to blog this promotion in the first place, was I liked that the Worcester Cardano meetup was advertised as:
i.) in-person and 
ii.) vibrant  and 
iii.) to do with in crypto which is a growing industry where I'm interested, and 
iv.) had to do with software tech/development/support like my day job career
Sadly I never did make it to this Cardano project meetup.
Now I searched up 'Cardano project under criticism' and do find the project is under some fire.
TIL - Today I Learned.
I'm not saying I now/still like or don't like the Cardano project moreso or less-so. 
As actually I have read over the project's blog and saw what I judged and judge to be a real development /project when I looked over it.
But what I learned is I need to take care what projects I'm promoting!
And I need to do some more research now on what is Cardano and why are people criticizing Cardano?
Needless to say one thing I learned is I'm not going to blog a second promotional post for the project _utill I at least vet it further and understand it better._ For example if further I do go to any Cardano meeup, then after that then I'd likely be able to make a better further judgement about it either way.
Onwards!

<h2>Review of Podcast Episode on ”Wallet activism” on Journey to Launch Podcast</h2>

Jamila Souffrant and her podcast guest Tanja Hester, are on fire this episode!!

Journey to launch podcast episode 242 <a href="https://journeytolaunch.com/episode242/">https://journeytolaunch.com/episode242/</a>

The guest Tanja Hester (of <a href="https://ournextlife.com/">https://ournextlife.com/</a>) says she'd rather trust folks blogging about financial independence are already financially independent themselves, or else rather they fully disclose that to their audience.

They talk about "climbing" and/vs. "lifting. Like climing the corporate ladder or the ladder of success, and/vs. helping others climb the ladder of success. In the context of earning money.

The guest Tanja Hester speaks about capitalism and capitalism as a tool to promote one's cause. Including using capitalism as force for good, even in the context of discrimination and racism and reverse racism. The idea of using capitalism to support your cause and support your tribe.

They talk and they mention as a rule of thumb, if you are paying more than 1/4 of a percent (0.25%) (0.0025, that's 25 thousandths) for ETF fees or Mutual fund management fees, then, you may be paying too much.

They talk about ”Wallet activism” and of the book by the same name by the guest host Tanja Hester.

Thanks to the folks from this podcast for this, it was great!

In conclusion, I loved this podcast episode because of the enthusiasm and smarts with which the guest and host discussed empowering their communities.

<h2 id="2022-01-01_2305_silver_bams"><a href="./2022-q1-blog.html#2022-01-01_2305_silver_bams">Earthling Yearly Income $12507 Dollars Per Year ₷¤365 Silver Bams Per Year for 2022</a></h2>

Time to calculate Silver Bams Ratio for 2022

This year, deciding to use 'worldwide average gdp per capita' in the Silver Bams calculation.

Last year was slightly different. ("Earthling Yearly Income $3000 Dollars Per Year ₷¤365 Silver Bams Per Year" <a href="https://wieldsilver.lemonmama.com/2021/2021-q3-blog.html">https://wieldsilver.lemonmama.com/2021/2021-q3-blog.html</a> )

Sources for this year:
- <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/gdp-per-capita">https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/gdp-per-capita</a> World gdp per capita for 2020 was $10,926
- <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD">https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD</a> GDP per capita (current US$) World 2020 10,910

- <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD">https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD</a> GDP per capita, current prices - U.S. dollars per capita World 2020 11,110

Calculations for this year:
$10,926
$10,910
$17,082
$11,110
+ -----
$50,028

$50,028 / 4 = $12,507

So I proclaim for 2022 the USD$ yearly income and expenses for an earthling is about $12,507

And I proclaim as before that the Silver Bams (₷¤) yearly income and expenses for an earthling is ₷¤365 Silver Bams Per Year.

And so for this blog the exchange rate of Silver Bams to Dollars will be:

$12,507 / 365 = $34 per day
₷¤365 / 365 = ₷¤1 per day

$1 USD dollar equals ₷¤ 1/34 Silver Bams (₷¤0.029 Silver Bams) for 2022.
₷¤1 Silver Bam equals $34 Dollars for 2022.

Well that's a big jump from 2021 where it had been a ratio of 8/1 (1/8). But that's how we roll this year. 

In conclusion, these are the Silver Bams (₷¤) multipliers for 2022 for this blog.


Coming soon on this blog! An updated 2022 list of some commodities and their costs in ₷¤Silver Bams! Don't miss it!

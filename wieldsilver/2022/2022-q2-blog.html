<h2 id="2022-06-16_1942"><a href="./2022-q2-blog.html#2022-06-16_1942">What role can Software Tech Support Specialist grow into? (2022 edition)</a></h2>

<h2>軟體客服工程師能升遷成為什麼工作? (二零二二年版本)</h2>

Now about 8 years later I'm thinking how to steer my career.

And so the question is, as in my old blog post:

"Into What Role Does a Software Support Engineer Grow?"
<a href="https://investorworker.lemonmama.com/2014/2014-11-04_2144-into-what-role-support.html">https://investorworker.lemonmama.com/2014/2014-11-04_2144-into-what-role-support.html</a>

And so here are some new answers.

Here are some roles that a Software Technical Support Specialist can aim for:

Support
Sales
Marketing
Talent/Recruiting
Business Development "Biz Dev"
Project Manager
Human Resources
Chief Operations Officer "COO"
Director of Operations
Operations Manager
Junior Operations Manager
Accountant
Chief Financial Officer "CFO"
Chief Executive Officer "CEO"
President
Vice President of Operations

And here are three corresponding college degrees/concentration that would be suitable for same:

Business administration 
MBA
Accounting

This is inspiring. Because it's not always clear what role a Tech Support Specialist could grow to, unless one gives it some thought.
And Tech Support Specialist itself doesn't have a clear-cut traditional college degree nor career path.
So this blog post clarifes some options.

In conclusion, these are some paths forward for a Technical Support Specialist on their career journey.

<h2 id="2022-05-15_2132"><a href="./2022-q2-blog.html#2022-05-15_2132">These Videos are so Smart and Funny from Berna Anat “Hey Berna” 這些伯納·艾娜特“嘿伯納”的影片又聰明又好笑</a></h2>

So recently I watched about ~9 or so of “Hey Berna” YouTube vids.

Update: O.M.G. I watched two of her 5-min-long- youtube videos and these two are HILARIOUS and serious about money and entertaining at the same time:

“How I Paid Off $50,000 in Debt 💸🙋 ” 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOA0UgW6570">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOA0UgW6570</a>

“Why I Have 12 Bank Accounts 😬💸”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_goAeCledg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_goAeCledg</a>

• She is smart. In the couple of videos. 
• She talks budgeting and money.
• But she throws in funny quirks and sings and funny voices and funny costumes and acts silly.
• But then snaps back serious again.

And this is amazing.
Because kids.
And adults.
We think money is boring.
But Berna's silly persona breaks through this barrier.
And but then she is smart too so we can trust her as an expert.
Brilliant.

In conclusion, These videos are so smart and funny from Berna Anat “Hey Berna”.

<h2 id="2022-05-15_2058-share-penny-day"><a href="./2022-q2-blog.html#2022-05-15_2058-share-penny-day">1 Share Produces 1 Penny Per Day</a></h2>
 
This is a timeless inspiring thought I want to come back to.
I like it because it doesn't say how much the share costs (although I'm assuming ~₷¤2.03 <a href="https://wieldsilver.lemonmama.com/2022/2022-q1-blog.html#2022-01-01_2305_silver_bams">Silver Bams</a> per share in 2022 which is reasonable)
The idea is 7000 units of money produces roughly 1 unit of dividends per day at a 5% annual dividend rate)
Why is this timeless? Because <a href="https://wieldsilver.lemonmama.com/2022/2022-q1-blog.html#2022-01-23_2011">Folks 313 Years Ago Described as Making an 8 Percent Dividend</a>
And so here is an inspiring mantra of mine now.

Whenever I want to talk about raising money for any cause with anyone.
I may tell them like:
"1 share makes 1 penny per day."

Any time I need money for something.
I'll think "1 share flows 1 penny per day."

In Silver Bams lingo that is “3600 Shares is one silver bam per day”.

And it will inspire me to buy one more share and hold it.
The thing is I like it better than saying (₷¤2.03 produces 1 penny per day) nor (7000 pennies produces 1 penny per day). 
Because it is more approachable.

In conclusion, 1 share produces 1 penny per day.

It becomes a theme in this podcast episode.

Not. Selling. Any. Stocks. Ever. (almost never)

Once with Argersinger.

"when you sell anything, you have to be right twice. .."

And once with a listener Jum's (/Jumm, David Gardner's "Biggest Fan") mailbag poem.

…”winners win, do not trim…”

Jum also writes in that she shan’t sell, she can bear even a 50% drop in portfolio value in 2020 pandemic.

This is inspiring.

If I think I want to rebalance my portfolio.

I think again.

Why rebalance?

If the companies are good companies, maybe I'll just not rebalance.

What if my personal biggest loser at the one year mark now is ~-30% down from what it had been?

What if my biggest winner at the one year mark now is ~70% up from what it had been?

Let them run. 

The losers will lose and the winners will win. 

Not. Selling. Any. Stocks. Ever. (almost never)

<h2>Spiffy Pops Are Like Febreze</h2>
<h2>出色的股票爆音就像風倍清</h2>

After this Motley Fool RBI podcast episode it becomes clear.

Spiffy Pops are nice for investors not traders.

Why celebrate a single-day pop?
A spiffy pop is a short term gain.
That's not what we look for as an investor.

But it is relative to the cost basis.
It would be a "reward" for holding a stock longer.

So a story about Febreze air freshener.
I heard 9/10 customers didn't "get" Febreze.
The 10th person said spraying Febreze is a reward for finishing cleaning a room.

A spiffy pop is like Febreze. 
The main goal isn't spiffy pop nor is it spraying Febreze.

I invest to enrich my life.
A spiffy pop is a symbolic reward.

I clean my room to enrich my life.
Spraying febreze is a symbolic reward.

Thanks to the RBI podcast.

In conclusion, Spiffy Pops are like febreze.

<h2>One’s Health and Wealth Affect Each Other</h2>
<h2>健康與財富彼此影響</h2>

One's health affects one's wealth.

And wealth affects health.

Someone said it on a podcast, Motley Fool Money Podcast.

Thank you.

There is truth in this.

<a href="https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/2022-01-18-microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard">https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/2022-01-18-microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard</a>

Near the end of the podcast episode, Alison and Bro talk about how health affects your wealth and how vice versa wealth affects your health.

Adding on to this idea because it fits. On this other podcast Journey To Launch they are talking about how the guest the persona of Brandon saves money so he can empower his community.
Also on the same episode the guest was saying that sometimes there is felt pressure from one's peers to buy a fancy car or expensive jewelry or clothes. And so that means one's community may affect one's wealth.

And so my note on that is that it fits this idea because it means one's wealth affects one's community and one's community affects one's wealth.

<a href="https://journeytolaunch.com/episode267/">https://journeytolaunch.com/episode267/</a>

In conclusion, one’s health and wealth affect each other.

<h2>Assume Most People Are Making It Up As They Go</h2>
<h2>假定大部分的人還在學怎麼去精明辦事還是需要幫忙的假定管理人員也是董事長也是</h2>

Paradigm shift.

For those who haven't yet.

I need to assume in 70-95% of all cases, all the owners and executives and managers in all companies including my company are still "making it up as they go" and "figuring it out as they go" and learning as they go and may also be inexperienced and struggling with their roles and projects ongoing.

Unless/until I see proven otherwise.

Why?

Because its often true. 

Amazing.

In past I had a false paradigm assumed that in order to get where an executive or manager is, they first became 100% highly skilled and extremely competent in every aspect of their job and maybe in life too. 

And held strongly for that paradigm for decades.

In other words I was like Olaf from Frozen II movie, for decades. 🎶"...when you're older, absolutely everything makes sense..."🎵

https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/frozen-2/28vdy71kJrjb

Come to find more and more. 70% to 95% of the time, most folks, including in executive and management, are largely same as other folks, and are still learning as they go.

However one group of traits is an exception. Confidence and bullshitting and sales and image. The executive and manager folks are by and large exceptionally good in the areas of confidence and bullshitting and sales and image.

However there will be exceptions -- people who are both broadly and deeply competent in executives and managers roles. However more and more I think those are the exceptions and sooo many folks (well more than half and in my estimation 70% or more) are "winging it" most of the time.

But there's good news for everyone here too.

But that means they still need MEGA help to be able to do their jobs.

And so there is HUGE opportunity for non-managers, say attendants or helpers, to keep in mind that executives and managers folks are making it up as they go in 70-95% of cases, then the helpers can have huge chances to help and make an impact. If the helpers listen and  think and solve and help, then there is possible big opportunity for everyone including themselves.

In conclusion, most people, including in all levels of an organization, are winging it most of the time. But this also means there is plenty of opportunity for everyone to work together to improve.

<h2>The Charming but Dangerous Idea That I Only Need One Good Company To Get Rich</h2>

It's a charming but maybe dangerous idea:

I only need one good company to get rich.

Some would say it's more possible, simple, and inspiring.

Some would say it's more “risky” and limiting.

Ultimately the individual companies themselves matter.

Important is which companies, and how many shares owned.

Important too is how many companies.

In conclusion these were meditations on the charming but dangerous idea that I only need one good company to get rich.

Here are some comments on this Audio Book:

<a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/11512709">https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/11512709</a>

Point 1.)
At about the 2h.8m. mark, the authors say they don’t think there’s any reason for someone to own more than 15 stocks and that 10 to 12 may be ideal.
My notes: 
- Nice. Bold.
- Thanks to the 2001 authors for saying 10-12 companies is enough.
- Since then the fool.com “Fools” generally tempered towards more diversification.
- 1 excellent company could produce abundant wealth, so then 10-12 could also, this is not a guarantee, but it's a charming idea.

Point 2.)
At about the 2h.12m. mark, they say that like everything else, money must be kept in perspective.
And that it’s possible to overvalue money and it’s possible to undervalue money.
My note: Well said.

In conclusion, these have been comments on this audio book.

<h2>Stock Splits Episode 1</h2>

Learning about Stock Splits Episode 1.

I.)
First example Nvidia.
Nvidia split this year 4 for 1
I see Nvidia (NVDA) Splits 1:4 [07/20/2021]
<a href="https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2021-11-10-stock-stories-vol-6-peaks-and">https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/2021-11-10-stock-stories-vol-6-peaks-and</a>
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-announces-4-for-1-stock-split-shares-jump-2.6-2021-05-24">https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-announces-4-for-1-stock-split-shares-jump-2.6-2021-05-24</a>
Morningstar splits indicator didn't show this immediately but does now.
Why?
I don't know.

II.)
Second example Toyota.
Toyota Motor Corp.(TM) Reverse 1 for 4 [2021-10-01]
<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/13/toyota-motor-corporation-tm-q4-2020-earnings-call/">https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/13/toyota-motor-corporation-tm-q4-2020-earnings-call/</a>
"...We will split ... easier to invest in our shares. ..."
A friend of mine owned TM (toyota motor (adr)) before the split.
But my friend says looking after the split my friend's shares owned of TM(ADR) were the same number of shares.
Why?
I don't know.
Ok i see this for Toyota Motor (TM)(ADR):
Year       2019 2020 2021
Shares Mil 1459 1423 1421
So that also doesn't show a major change in shares outstanding before and after the split.
Not a 5x change at least.

III.)
Third example Trade Desk.
Trade Desk, Inc. (TTD) 10 for 1 [2021-06-17]

In conclusion, I don't know about stock splits. Stock splits are mostly a sausage factory to me.

<h2>A Bad Habit is Like a Ghost</h2>

A bad habit is like a ghost.

Like a tv-watching ghost compelling one watch too much tv.
Like a coffee-drinking ghost compelling one drink too much coffee.

A good habit is like a good spirit.

These things may have been scripted in some past time of ones life, including by ones family and friends when one was young. for better or worse.

Visualizing a plan ahead of time is like time travel.
For example how athletes like Michael Phelps supposedly envisioned the swim race ahead of time.
And like how one plans the next morning's activity and lays out one's tomorrow clothes the night before.
And like how everything is created twice. Once when one plans it then once when one does it. Like in "Lovey Dovey Covey" (of 7 Habits fame).

[2022-04-05 update:

Also. Breaking habits can be done by using "the first creation"

Of lovey dovey covey of 7 Habits fame, "the first creation" and "the second creation"

https://www.alibris.com/The-7-Habits-of-Highly-Effective-People/book/66433

In other words I want to not drink coffee habit in the morning every morning.

I need to, the night before, like Michael Phelps envisioned himself doing high performance swimming, in my mind, run through and envision myself what exactly I'm going to do when I get up the next morning, step by step, that's doing something that's not drinking coffee, and including how I'll be feeling as I do it.

And including I envisioning myself wanting to drink coffee but actively deciding to not drink coffee and how I'll be feeling as I go through this.

Also. This is similar to the idea of time travel. 
I admit I did watch Harry Potter 3 movie (Azkaban) tonight and they were doing time traveling ;) Also. this is similar to divination. Also in this movie.

But it is.
